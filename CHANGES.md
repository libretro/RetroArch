# Future
- PATCHES: Add support for XDelta-formatted patches.

# 1.16.0
- 3DS: Update __system_initArgv
- 3DS: Update SquirrelJME 3DS Core information along with icons.
- ANDROID: Rewrite input handling to better support AINPUT_SOURCE_STYLUS
- ANDROID: Prevent the android quick tap mouse click emulation while pressing a button on the on-screen overlay
- AUDIO: Fast-Forward Audio Resampling
- AUDIO: Reinit audio on audio sync toggle
- AUDIO: Count audio samples in stats when rate control is disabled
- AUDIO/PULSEAUDIO: Support device list for PulseAudio
- AUDIO/WASAPI: WASAPI Frame Delay fix + cleanups
- AUDIO/WASAPI/MIDI: Frame Delay correction
- ARCHIVE/ZIP: Improve ZIP decompression
This reduces the amount of memory Retroarch needs to extract a ROM file.
It will only need the size of the ROM plus 128KiB to extract the file
from the ZIP. Previously it needed as much as twice that amount if the
compression ratio was not great. This is useful on memory constrained
platforms and has no impact on platforms with plenty of memory.
Handles all cases correctly (with and without MMAP, for cores that
require fullpath or not, small and big ZIP files).

Most input_overlay_deinit calls are replaced with input_overlay_unload, which caches the overlay unless initing/deiniting core or disabling overlays.
Loading a cached overlay is done as a swap, intended for osk_toggle.
- INPUT/OVERLAY: Add input_overlay_check_mouse_cursor() to preserve show/hide mouse behavior
- INPUT/OVERLAY: Don't apply input_overlay_show_mouse_cursor in windowed mode (controlled by mouse grab only)

# 1.15.0
- AI SERVICE: Fix NVDA switching to Powershell on speak
- ANDROID: In Android builds, add input_android_physical_keyboard configuration option and its corresponding menu entry to force a device to act as a physical keyboard. When running on Android, RetroArch considers most devices that emit dpad events as gamepads, even if they also emit other keyboard events; this is usually the right thing to do, but it has the side effect of not letting some actual keyboards (e.g.: Logitech K480) act as such inside RetroArch. This configuration option allows users to manually select a specific input device to act as a physical keyboard instead of a gamepad, which is handy when emulating computers as opposed to consoles.
- APPLE: Add App Category to a few places it should have been
- APPLE/MFI: Prevent crash when controller player index is unset (-1)
- AUTOMATIC FRAME DELAY: Helped delay to decrease easier when it should and helped delay to stay put when it should when triggering pause & menu with or without pause & fast-forward & slow-motion & geometry change
- AUTOMATIC FRAME DELAY: Recalibrate delay on video reinit (fullscreen toggle and such)
- AUTOMATIC FRAME DELAY: Show (x effective) only in menu item and not in dropdown list items when auto is enabled
- CHEEVOS: Allow repositioning of RetroAchievement notifications
- CHEEVOS/MENU: Add Achievements Visibility submenu option
- CHEEVOS/MENU: Startup Summary split off from Verbose Mode, added option to hide for games with zero core cheevos
- CHEEVOS/MENU: 'Unlocks/Mastery' split into two options
- CHEEVOS/MENU: 'Account/Login Messages' split off from 'Verbose', gated all login success/error messages
- CONFIG/INPUT: Unload restores current global config
- CONFIG/INPUT/OVERRIDES: Removing a file does not unload current override
- CONFIG/INPUT/OVERRIDES: Saving an empty override removes the file if it exists, and won't save when it does not
- CONFIG/INPUT/OVERRIDES: Prevent the use of RUNLOOP_FLAG_OVERRIDES_ACTIVE with appendconfig
- CORE OPTION: Core option setting type checks. Added checks for getting and setting core option type, since otherwise there will be a crash on close content after browsing to core option categories. Also fixed the no-show switch icon for lone wolf "Lock Installed Core".
- CLI: Update selected save slot when start with cli --entryslot
- CLI: Decouple config CLI append and config overrides
- CLI/MENU/XMB: Stop showing bogus previous icon on CLI launch

- EMSCRIPTEN: Add HAVE_PATCH support for Emscripten
- EMSCRIPTEN: Add BSV/Replay support for Emscripten
- EMSCRIPTEN: Add command and stdin_cmd features to emscripten RA. update libretro.js to show how commands could be sent over emscripten stdin.
- FRAME DELAY/MENU: Show Frame Delay without VSync
- GENERAL: Start unpause restriction. Limit the feature using retropad start button to unpause RA to the setting it was made for; "pause on controller disconnect".
- GENERAL: Savestate thumbnail aspect ratio fallback. Thanks to at least one certain core that announces aspect ratio as 0, we have to add the same fallback in savestate thumbnails that is happening elsewhere in normal video driver use anyway.
- GENERAL: Add support for system subdirs per core/database. Added the trivial and graceful automatic ability to send a different system directory to cores if it exists, for keeping the system dir more sane. First by using the core/library name just like in configs and saves, and then by playlist name, like in thumbnails, and of course default to the current global system dir.
- GENERAL: Ignore system subdir replacement if subdir has subdirs.
- GENERAL: Restore cached video driver always on quit
- IOS: Include 'Update Core Info Files'
- IOS: Fix #14778 - In addition to sending logs to asl_client, add them to the logfile.
- IOS/VULKAN/MOLTENVK: Vulkan video driver on iOS
- LATENCY/PREEMPTIVE FRAMES: Add Preemptive Frames to Latency Settings. RunAhead alternative that reruns core logic to "rewrite history" before the current frame. Frames are only rerun when the controller state changes, so it's faster overall.
- LATENCY/PREEMPTIVE FRAMES: Call retro_run before retro_serialize (#14893). Fixes preemptive frames not starting up with a few cores
- LIBRETRO-COMMON/VFS/FILESTREAM: Fixes filestream_vscanf regression
- LOCALIZATION: Updates
- LOCALIZATION: Enable localization of video rotation, orientation, and aspect ratio option values.
- LOCALIZATION: Mixer stream localization also added
- LOCALIZATION/MENU/HELP: Context dependent help text for audio and video drivers. Language corrections
- LOCALIZATION/MENU/LANGUAGE: Language submenu now shows the progress of translated strings for each language.
- LOCALIZATION: Help texts now localizable through Crowdin.
- LIBRETRO: Enable RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_SET_SUPPORT_NO_GAME for libretro-video-processor
- LIBRETRO/HW: Add GET_HW_CONTEXT_NEGOTIATION_INTERFACE_SUPPORT. Works around issues in v1 interface where it was not possible to
query what frontend would do when faces with newer interface versions. This env-call gives stronger guarantees how things have to work.
- INPUT: Allowing keyboard hotkeys to work without hotkey modifier if modifier is only mapped to RetroPad
- INPUT: Allowing keyboard hotkey keys for typing if hotkey modifier is set to keyboard but not pressed
- INPUT: Allowing keyboard RetroPad keys for typing if emulated device type is "None"
- INPUT/AUTOCONFIG: Check for 'enable_hotkey' also from autoconf binds
- INPUT/BLUETOOTH: Fix a crash in for BT HID devices. (#14922) pad_connection_destroy() frees slots, no need to free it again.
- INPUT/BSV/REPLAY: Don't start video recording when BSV recording starts
- INPUT/BSV/REPLAY: Don't double-record inputs in BSV recording

- INPUT/BSV/REPLAY: Add keyboard recording support to BSV
- INPUT/BSV/REPLAY: Fix BSV playback from a starting state for DOSbox
- INPUT/BSV/REPLAY: Associate states with replays. Now states can be saved and loaded during replay recording and playback in a way that keeps the integrity of the recording. Recordings also have a (moderately) unique identifier associated with them.
- INPUT/BSV/REPLAY: Add checkpointing feature for replay recordings. If cores are not deterministic, or if they only have bounded determinism, we can obtain less drift if replay files also contain periodic checkpoint states.  These are configured by the new retroarch setting replay_checkpoint_interval (measured in seconds).  States are inserted into the replay file in between frames. This also fixes the settings display for the replay autoincrement max keep setting.
- INPUT/FRAMEADVANCE: Use non-rendering pause mode when frameadvance is triggered
- INPUT/HOTKEYS/OVERLAYS: Do not block input overlay hotkeys
- INPUT/HOTKEYS: Hotkey blocking correction. Turned out the previous hotkey blocking changes worked properly only with winraw driver and not the rest (at least with Windows), because input_keyboard_event() could be called at the wrong moment, and thus storing keyboard menu press there broke the separation of controller Guide menu button and keyboard menu key. Also allowed the blocking to work in both directions so that controller hotkeys won't get blocked if only keyboard has "enable_hotkey" bind.
- INPUT/LINUX/UDEV: Fix udev guns input when id_mouse is not id_joystick
- MENU: Rename 'Standalone Cores' to 'Contentless Cores'
- MENU: Music files should also obey builtin_mediaplayer_enable (#14967) Disabling the built in media player should be possible for music files
as well. Without this, sound files can not be opened from file browser with cores that support them.
- MENU: Relocated items to a more logical order
- MENU: Corrected some title capitalizations (when/before/after are not low case, but for/the/a are)
- MENU/AUDIO: Add dropdown menu for audio device
- MENU/HELP: Help for turbo modes (#14919). Help text added for each of the selectable turbo modes.
- MENU/INPUT: Add unified back action to all menu drivers. Usability boost for all menu drivers resulting in similar behavior as with Ozone currently, which is pressing back/cancel enough the selection jumps first to Main Menu and when pressed again jumps to the first item, so that when a core is running, Quick Menu is very quickly accessible from anywhere. And when core is not running, the first item would be Load Core.
- MENU/INPUT: Override bind save + menu manager overhaul
- MENU/INPUT: Allowed and fixed input bind saving to overrides
- MENU/INPUT: Overhauled override menu
- MENU/INPUT: Pressing Start on the top active file entry reloads current overrides as startup would

- MENU/XMB: Fixed playlist manager icons to take Explore Views into account properly
- MENU/XMB: Changed XMB Explore View title to match Ozone
- MENU/XMB: Added "Switch Icons" option

- MENU/XMB: Fixed "Menu Scale Factor" to not require restarting to get the actual end result
- MENU/XMB: Adjusted scale factor to behave better with both layouts
- MENU/XMB: Fixed savestate thumbnails and adjusted vertical fade factor in "Handheld" layout
- MENU/XMB: Changed thumbnail shadow to outline and tightened fullscreen thumbnail margins
- MENU/XMB: Adjusted global shadow opacity
- MENU/XMB: Remove "Framebuffer opacity" from XMB as it does not use it. Also, rename the corresponding menu title, since "framebuffer" is not that intuitive.
- MENU/OZONE: Fixed playlist manager icons to take Explore Views into account properly
- MENU/OZONE: Refresh thumbnail on close content hotkey
- MENU/OZONE: Ozone footer enhancements (#14926). Add Help button (Select) and Reset to Default (Start) to footer where applicable.
- MENU/OZONE: Ozone footer enhancements (#14934). Display Help footer only if there is actual info to be displayed, either actual help, or sublabel if it is not visible otherwise.
- MENU/OZONE: Ozone footer enhancement: Scan button (#14949). Display Scan button in footer when it is applicable.
- MENU/OZONE: Add Clear button to Ozone footer (#14947). Add indication of Clear button when it is applicable (currently: keybinds).
- MENU/MATERIALUI: Added missing Favorites+History icons in playlist manager
- MENU/MATERIALUI: Added "Switch Icons" option
- MENU/CHEATS: Added missing icons in cheats (Delete + Copy After/Before)
- MENU/CHEATS: Fixed label capitalization in cheats (Add New After/Before This)
- MENU/SOUNDS: Add scrolling sounds for RGUI, XMB, MaterialUI and Ozone.
- MENU/SOUNDS: Better scrolling sound implementation, add new 'notice back' sound
- MENU/SOUNDS: Scroll sound fixes. Correctly get list size in xmb.c for playing scrolling sound when switching categories, play the scrolling sound when pressing cancel in ozone, play the sound when scrolling with ZL and ZR, play the correct sound when scrolling with L
- MENU/WIDGETS: Show square sized widget on volume mute. Volume widget is currently fixed size always, and thus showing a lot of empty space when muting, therefore shorten the box to icon size only when muting.
- MIYOO: L3/R3 support for Dingux Gamepad controller device.
- NETWORKING: Call ssl_socket_close for SSL sockets
- NETWORKING/CHEEVOS: net_http - Temporary fix for cheevos crash. Don't use new timeout/poll code for cheevos HTTP requests.
- NETWORKING/MENU: Network information cleanup:
- NETWORKING/MENU: Remove extra space from : delimiter
- NETWORKING/MENU: Trim useless/duplicate garbage from the end of ipv6 address. Windows shows %[adapter number], Linux shows %[adapter name], which already shows before the address
- NETWORKING/STDIN: Add LOAD_STATE_SLOT N command to stdin/network protocol
- OSD/STATISTICS: Add Run-Ahead data to on-screen statistics
- OSD/STATISTICS: Notification font + statistics adjustments

- OSX/MACOS: Hide "Disable composition" option (osx does not support disabling composition)
- OSX/MACOS: Make sure to use the file system path name, not the URL name
- OSX/MACOS/IOHIDMANAGER: Various memory access fixes to prevent crashes (#14459) (#15000). Prevent double free and null dereference when the controller is quickly reconnected. Handle error when controller device query returns null instead of crashing.
- OSX/MACOS/METAL BUILD: Fix input events (keyboard/mouse) sometimes going lost when switching between fullscreen and windowed mode. Fixes lots of longstanding issues
- OSX/MACOS/OPENGL: Fix for fullscreen OpenGL driver in Metal macOS build
- OSX/MACOS/VULKAN/MOLTENVK: Default to Vulkan driver when available (for 10.13 Metal Universal build)
- OSX/MACOS/VULKAN/MOLTENVK: Updated Vulkan on Metal for OSX via MoltenVK
- OSX/MACOS/VULKAN/MOLTENVK/HDR: Fix non-HDR colors
- OSX/MACOS/SLANG: The change to apply shaders would be executed and then a command to apply shaders would immeidately be enqueued, to run asynchronously
after the current event handler, which then did exactly the same. Fixes issue #14789 - Turning on shaders on Metal build 1.14.0 stable for Mac OS will slow emulation drastically thing, creating a busy loop.
- PS2: Avoid loading extra drivers when not needed. Fixed a bug where it wasn't using the variable extra_drivers, for loading the specific IRX needed drivers. This is increasing compatibility with some specific PS2 models that sometimes fail when loading cores.
- PS3/PSL1GHT: Add improvements to the RSX driver (#14965)
- PS3/PSL1GHT: Add modern_alpha_blend and modern_opaque rsx shaders

- QB/CONFIGURE: Add new flags - HAVE_UPDATE_CORE_INFO, ASSETS_DIR, FILTERS_DIR
- RECORDING: Add recordings to video history playlist
- REWIND: Don't take rewind steps while menu pause active
- RUNLOOP: Currently when core is paused, video output will be stopped completely too, making it impossible to animate widgets while paused, therefore:
- RUNLOOP: Added a new runloop state for pause which renders last cached frame
- RUNLOOP: Allowed rewinding while paused so that it acts like backwards frameadvance. Also moved rewind step taking before menu iteration so that steps won't be lost while in menu when menu_pause is disabled
- RUNLOOP: State load and reset while paused will forget pause for x frames in order to show proper output
- RUNLOOP: Allowed reading pause hotkey while menu is active
- RUNLOOP: Allowed reading screenshot hotkey while menu is active
- RUNLOOP: Joined 2 fullscreen hotkey checks to one (Any ideas why they were separated for paused and non-paused states, since one works fine for both..?)
- RUNLOOP: Implement GET_HW_CONTEXT_NEGOTIATION_INTERFACE_SUPPORT. Fairly trivial. Just report the latest version.

- SHADERS: Shader Preset - Wildcard Replacement in Paths on Load. When a simple preset loads, text wildcards which are found in paths inside the presets will be replaced with values coming from the current RetroArch context. The replacement will be executed on both texture paths and reference paths.
- SHADERS/SLANG/SPIRVCROSS: Update to latest SPIRV-Cross, fixing Metal shader compilation issues along the way
- STATICALLY LINKED/SALAMANDER: Fix salamander config save on fork for static platforms
- TVOS/VULKAN/MOLTENVK: Vulkan on tvOS
- VIDEO: Allow manual video swap interval forcing. The addition of auto swap interval effectively prevented manual forcing, which is beneficial when the rate is not reported properly. Therefore use the interval in the calculation only when using automatic interval.
- VULKAN: Fix crash when using multiple physical devices and HW core (#14889) 
- VULKAN: Detect if wrong PhysicalDevice is returned.
- VULKAN: Actually query physical device before creating core device.
- VULKAN: Define and implement v2 of context negotiation interface
- VULKAN: Add v2 of context negotiation interface.
- VULKAN: Add vkEnumerateInstanceVersion symbol.
- VULKAN: Implement v2 context negotiation
- VULKAN: Use compute shaders to upload RGB565
- VULKAN: Fix regression with RGB565 and OriginalHistory.
- VULKAN/WAYLAND: Don't clamp the number of requested images. Due to an unfortunate "feature", MESA always reports 4 as the Vulkan surface's minImageCount in Wayland.
However, values of 2 and 3 work perfectly well, even if they are out of spec, providing way better latencies when using the Vulkan backend on Wayland.
So this removes the artificial clamping that was being done to desired_swapchain_images, because it's not really necessary and was causing very noticeable input lag on Wayland+Vulkan.
- VULKAN/MENU/RGUI: Fix RGUI on Vulkan on platforms that don't have _pack16 VkFormats
- VULKAN/MACOS/OSX: avoid using _PACK16 pixel formats on platforms without them
- WAYLAND: On scaled desktops the wayland backend deciding to resize based on values multiplied by the scale factor twice. Resulting in continuous attempts to rebuild the swapchain when in fullscreen.
- WAYLAND: Wait for splash screen configuration. Before, configuration (resize) events for the initial wayland window could happen before or after set_video_mode which could result in a small or corrupted window. Now we make sure that the initial window has processed it's resize events before window size is set by set_video_mode.
- WAYLAND: Changes the initial window to show a RetroArch logo copied from the icon of the X11 backend.
- WAYLAND: Build pointer-constraints and relative-pointer protocols.
- WAYLAND/GL: GL is sometimes not rescaling property (Super + Left).
- WIN32: Ignore window limiting with fixed position. The other resizing part already took this into account, but WM_GETMINMAXINFO did not.
- WIN32/INPUT: Add support for mouse button swap
- WIN32: Fix keyboard event characters. Added sending key chars to all input drivers (currently they only send scan codes), and also missing mods for raw.
- WIN32: Fix restart if path has spaces. CreateProcess does not like to have anything executable path related in the second parameter lpCommandLine if the path has spaces. Thus strip everything from args except the actual parameters.

- D3D12: Made D3D12 viewport and scissors to behave more like Vulkan drivers (or be more correct)
- D3D12: Fixed validation error on start up due to buffers not being setup correctly for one frame
- D3D12: Fixed some shaders not appearing with the d3d12 driver - this reintroduces a validation error though but it seems to work as in not crash and is the old RA behaviour. Guess we need a different way of fixing the validation issue.
- DATABASE/EXPLORE/VIEW: Bugfix - RGUI did not clear thumbnail on non-playlist items such as Save and Delete
menu_explore_get_entry_playlist_index() returns -1 on invalid entries, but the variable where it was stored was unsigned
- DATABASE/EXPLORE/VIEW: Bugfix - XMB+Ozone cleared thumbnail in Quick Menu when navigating away from Run
- DRM/ODROID GO2: Implement get_video_size for DRM GL context driver
- FASTFORWARD: Restore framelimit on fastforward toggle. Fast-forward was broken after toggling vrr_runloop off, since it will force frame limit to 1.0 (even on every frame) and never restores it. So let's make sure the wanted ratio is applied when toggling FF (Fastforward).
- FFMPEG CORE: Fix runtime error in FFmpeg core when build with FFmpeg n5.1.2 and OpenGL ES
- GFX/VIDEO FILTERS: (picoscale_256x_320x240) Added snn function to upscale Fuse (ZX Spectrum) core borderless output to 320x240. ZX Spectrum resolution of 256x192 was previously unsupported.

- MENU/OZONE: Allowed drawing sidebar and thumbnail bar background color also when core is running
- MENU/OZONE: Stopped using different padding and position for savestate thumbnails vs imageviewer
- MENU/OZONE: Removed gradient background effect when core is running, because some themes already have gradient background, which creates ugly rough steps

- MENU/OZONE: Some whitespace corrections
- MENU/UX: Extend OFF menu value colors
- MENU/UX: Menu icon improvements - Menu Visibility icons (Quick Menu + Settings)

- MENU/UX: Menu icon improvements - View save + delete icons
- MENU/UX: Menu icon improvements - Moved Explore + Views below Standalone Cores
- MENU/UX/OZONE: Removed icons from menus where others items don't have icons, and added icons to menus where the rest have icons
- MENU/UX/OZONE: Changed the way "no icon" is handled from kludgy way of not drawing SUBSETTING icon
- MENU/UX/XMB: Changed playlist entry index positioning to bottom right when thumbnails are in vertical mode, because big lists will overlap with arrow and current "breadcrumb" icons when the position is next to current selection
- MENU/UX/XMB: Added a rather nasty hack to prevent showing wrong icons under Explore as "breadcrumb" icon
- MENU/UX/XMB: Optimized certain icon drawing loops (Main horizontal icons were looped even when not visible, and all previous "breadcrumb" icons were looped when only one certain was needed)
- MENU/UX/MATERIALUI: Fixed showing icons where there should not be any (Waitable Swapchains, Show Recording + Streaming)
- OSX/MACOS: Fixed Cocoa keyboard not allowing to map Analog stick
- PS2: Use the recently created ps2_drivers which makes easier the loading and init of all the drivers: Memory Card, USB, HDD, Audio, Controllers
- PS2: Adds exFat support for USB, and probably solves some unexpected issues when using an HDD driver for booting cores/games.
- SDL GFX: Fix no menu on start/blank screen issue.

- IOS13+: Adds iPad Trackpad Support to iOS13 Project (for iOS 13.4 and above)
- INPUT: Fixed the way devices were previously indexed. Input devices were only being indexed in order and would stop at the first time an input has no device connected to it. The problem is when a device gets disconnected, that input will have no devices connected to it, but the next input may still have a device connected. So, that makes changing the port of the currently connected devices impossible.
- INPUT/AUTOCONFIG: Add option for pause on controller disconnect
- INPUT/AUTOCONFIG: Driver independent disconnection notification. Should show disconnect notification now properly on Windows with XInput and/or DirectInput pads
- INPUT/HID: Added usb hid controllers for the famous ZeroDelay encoder and also for "Kade: Kick Ass Dynamic Encoder" to be able to use some custom arcade sticks.
- INPUT/OVERLAY: Add eightway area types.
- INPUT/OVERLAY: Ignore hitboxes with zero area. I.e. Set 'reach_x' or 'reach_y' to zero to ensure no hitbox math is done. This simplifies designating animation-only descriptors (e.g. for eightway areas) or obsolete descriptors.

- SCANNER/PS1: Improved scanning of PS1 discs
- SCANNER/PS2: Added serial scanning of PS2 discs - should now scan DVDs and other discs which were previously missed
- THUMBNAIL: If you rename title, you cannot use the thumbnail image. because the thumbnail filename and the title must be the same.
If there is no thumbnail with title, find the thumbnail image with rom-name. This has nothing to do with IME.
- THREADED VIDEO/GLCORE: Fix regression 'Shader presets dont load, when video driver is set to glcore'
- VULKAN: Fix HDR inverse tonemapping. Only skip tonemapper if HDR10 is explicitly enabled by last shader pass. Otherwise, we are simply just inheriting the bit-depth of the swapchain.

- NETWORK/NETPLAY/DISCOVERY: Ensure fixed width ints on packet struct
- NETWORK/NETPLAY/DISCOVERY: Support for IPv4 tunneling (6to4)
- NETWORK/NETPLAY/DISCOVERY/TASKS: Netplay/LAN Discovery Task refactor -  aims to prevent blocking the main thread while awaiting for the LAN discovery timeout; This is accomplished by moving the whole discovery functionality into its task and using a non-blocking timer to finish the task. Also fixes discovery sockets not being made non-blocking, which could cause the main thread to hang for very long periods of time every pre-frame.
- NETWORK/NETPLAY/TASKS: Find content task refactor - fixes many issues along the way, including a couple of nasty memory leaks that would leak thousands of bytes each time the task ran. It also expands the original concept by matching currently run content by filename (CRC matching is always performed first though).

- SHADERS: Shader Preset Loading of Multiple additional #references lines for settings
- SHADERS: Shader Load Extra Parameter Reference Files - this adds the ability to put additional #reference lines inside shader presets which will load additional settings. The first reference in the preset still needs to point at a chain of presets which ends with a shader chain, and subsequent #reference lines will load presets which only have parameter values adjustment. This allows presets to be made with a modular selection of settings. For example with the Mega Bezel one additional reference could point at a preset which contained settings for Night mode vs Day mode, and another reference could point to a preset which contained settings for how much the screen should be zoomed in.

the first frame, and was causing black screens/driver resets. The ffmpeg core seems to do this.
- D3D11: Fix shaders with scaled framebuffers
- D3D11: Add flip model support - fallback to blit model for OSes where flip model is not supported (windows 7 and earlier). Will add a menu option later allowing the user to switch inbetween the two

- FONTS/FREETYPE: Use fontconfig to select fonts if available
- INPUT: Add hold mode for turbo fire 'Single Button'
- INPUT MAPPING: Refresh bind list on device type change
- INPUT MAPPING/REMAPPING: Minor bugfix - Remap file browsing starts navigation at input_remapping_directory even if the core-subdir (where saved files go) exists
Having remaps for many different cores makes finding the active core files cumbersome, especially because remaps are not compatible between different cores (but maybe for cores emulating the same hardware)

function skips the driver if the screen is non rotated to fall back to
the regular DRM driver.
- OGA: Fix messages from not disappearing
- OGA: Implement RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_GET_CURRENT_SOFTWARE_FRAMEBUFFER. This is a faster rendering codepath for software rendered libretro cores that some libretro cores use right now. Video drivers in RetroArch have to explicitly implement this for this codepath to work at runtime.
- OPENDINGUX: Add/Optimise rumble interface
- OPENDINGUX: Fix frozen video when enabling fast forward
- OPENDINGUX/SDL: OSD font clean-up
- OPENDINGUX/SDL: Enable selection of image interpolation method when using 'sdl_dingux' gfx driver

- OVERLAYS: Add option to scale overlays automatically (with aspect ratio correction)
- OVERLAYS: Hide Overlay When Gamepad is Connected. Overlays will be hidden automatically when a gamepad is connected in port 1, and shown again when the gamepad is disconnected.
- OVERLAYS: New default overlays for mobile (neo-retropad)
- OVERLAYS: In addition to overlay scale, the user can now set an Overlay Aspect Adjustment factor. Most overlays are designed for 16:9 displays, which means they become stretched/ugly on modern wide aspect phones and suchlike. By changing the Overlay Aspect Adjustment factor, a user can scale the overlay width/height to achieve a uniform appearance regardless of display resolution.
- OVERLAYS: Since scaling a gamepad overlay can result in buttons being squished too close together (or being pulled too far apart), the user can now adjust the effective spacing of the different 'halves' of an overlay via Overlay Horizontal Separation and Overlay Vertical Separation factors. Overlay Horizontal Separation divides the overlay in two vertically (left/right, at the centre point), and applies a spacing offset (positive or negative) between the UI elements on each side; Overlay Vertical Separation does the same, but the split is horizontal (top/bottom)
- OVERLAYS/FIX: The Overlay X Offset and Overlay Y Offset options have been fixed, and now work correctly
- OVERLAYS/FIX: All of the above options (and Overlay Scale) are configured and saved independently for landscape and portrait display orientations - so adjusting everything for a nice landscape layout won't break the portrait display
- OVERLAYS/FIX: When using the Vulkan gfx driver, memory is leaked every time an overlay is freed
- OVERLAYS/FIX: When threaded video is enabled, loading overlays with no images (i.e. utility-type overlays, where everything is hidden until the screen is touched) can generate segfaults due to improper usage of realloc()
- OVERLAYS/FIX: When Show Inputs on Overlay is enabled, ASAN reports bit shift errors due to an incorrect range check when handling turbo inputs - essentially, there is no upper limit to the considered input id range, which means overlay hotkeys (menu toggle, etc.) are incorrectly treated as having turbo support, causing bit shifts using wildly inappropriate id indices

- SDL2/VIDEO: Get the SDL2 video driver to work in Wayland/KMS
- SAVESTATES: Adding savestate garbage collector for autoincrement stavestates. As some issues indicate, there's an issue with
the autoincrement save slot feature: slot index will increase and very old saves won't be deleted. This adds support to delete old save states with a user defined
save state limit (global). Instead of wrapping around the slot counter it will simply delete the oldest save, since it is simpler. For now there's a limit of one deletion per save, which ensures a user cannot delete many saves by accident if they set the limit too low.
- SAVESTATES/SAVEFILES: Ensure save file and playlist compression is disabled by default
- SHADERS: Add option to remember last selected shader preset/shader pass directories
- SHADERS: Use last selected shader preset directory when changing shaders via previous/next hotkeys
- SHADERS: Remove Parameters line
- SHADERS: Shaders fix for duplicate parameters loading bug
- SHADERS: Fix Crash change num shader passes in UI

- VIDEO FILTERS: Add 'Upscale1.5x' video filter
- VITA: Disable temporarily VitaGL
- VITA: Fix bubble name
- VITA: proper handling of boot params
- VITA: Default menu scale 1.5x to improve readability
- WIFI/LAKKA: Add a proper WiFi menu, with Enable/Disable & Disconnect options. This also allows WiFi passwords to be remembered. The underlying tool (connman) allows to store passswords (that's why it auto connects whenever you boot a Lakka device), so we expose this so that the user does not have to re-input the pass when connecting to a saved wifi.
- WII/HID: Added HID support for HORI mini wired ps4 gamepad

# 1.9.0
- 3DS: Fix sound crackling when paused

- CORE OPTIONS: Pressing OK (or clicking/tapping) on a 'boolean toggle' core option no longer opens a drop-down list. The value now toggles directly, just like boolean options everywhere else in the menu
- CORE OPTIONS: Toggling an option that changes the number of core options being displayed (i.e. things like `Show Advanced Audio/Video Settings) no longer resets the navigation pointer to the start of the list
- CORE OPTIONS: Before, RetroArch would identify core option values as being 'boolean' if they had labels matching the specific strings enabled or disabled. Most core devs would abide by this, but not always... As a result, we sometimes would end up with misidentified values, with all kinds of Enabled, Off, True, etc. strings littering the menu, in place of proper toggle switches. All boolean-type value labels are now detected, and replaced with standard ON/OFF strings.
- CLI: A new command line option --load-menu-on-error has been added

# 1.8.9
- AUTO SAVESTATES: Ensure save states are correctly flushed to disk when quitting RetroArch (fixes broken save states when exiting RetroArch - without first closing content - with 'Auto Save State' enabled)
- BUILTIN CORES: Builtin cores like ffmpeg and imageviewer would previously try  to erroneously load a dynamic core named 'builtin' - this would fail and would just be a wasteful operation - this now skips dylib loading in libretro_get_system_info for builtin cores
- CHEEVOS: Report API errors when unlocking achievements or submitting leaderboards
- CHEEVOS: Support less common file extensions
- CHEEVOS: Disable hardcore mode when playing BSV file
- CHEEVOS: Correctly report unlocked non-hardcore achievements when hardcore is paused

# 1.8.7
- 3DS: Add IDs for Frodo
- 3DS: Enable basic networking / cheevos
- CHEEVOS/BUGFIX: Opening achievements list would crash RetroArch with badges enabled (on new games)
- CHEEVOS: Option to start a session with all achievements active
- CHEEVOS: Don't perform unnecessary cheevos initialisation when cheevos are disabled. Should reduce startup times when loading content.

# 1.8.6
- 3DS: Add IDs for UZEM, TGB Dual, and NeoCD
- 3DS: Fix font driver horizontal text alignment
- 3DS: Allow button presses up to INPUT_MAX_USERS - this enables the 3DS to bind and use buttons and axis for users up to the maximum set by 'Max Users' in the input settings menu.
- 3DS: Disable video filter if upscaled resolution exceeds hardware limits. The 3DS has a maximum video buffer size of 2048x2048. This is sufficient for every core that it supports, but when using software video filters the core output resolution is doubled. This is made worse by the fact that the video filter upscaling buffer size is dependent upon the maximum output resolution of the core - which in some cases is very large indeed (e.g. pcsx-rearmed sets a maximum width of 1024, for enhanced resolution support). The 3DS has very limited 'linear memory' for graphics buffer purposes, and a large base core buffer + video filter buffer can easily exceed this - which may also disable video output, or cause a crash. This PR very simply adds a 3DS-specific check to the video filter initialisation: if the resultant upscaling buffer exceeds the hardware limitation, then the filter is automatically disabled.
- 3DS/FONT/BUGFIX: Text colour was wrong: the RGBA channels were muddled, and R was always set to 255
- 3DS/FONT/BUGFIX: When drawing multiline strings, the line spacing was completely incorrect
- 3DS/FONT: Improves the appearance of the drop shadow effect on notification text.
- 3DS/ARCHIVE/7Z: Re-enable 7zip support.
- ARCHIVE/ZIP: Expand functionality of 'rzip_stream' interface. This PR expands the functionality of the new rzip_stream archived stream interface such that it now has almost complete feature parity with the standard file_stream interface, and can therefore be used as a drop-in replacement in most situations
- AI SERVICE: Hide redundant entries when service is disabled
- AI SERVICE: Added in auto-translate support
- AI SERVICE: support for NVDA and SAPI narration

- CHEEVOS/BUGFIX: Report non-memorymap GBA cores as unsupported
- COMMANDLINE: Advise against using -s and -S variables on the command line. …
- CONFIG FILE: Only write config files to disk when parameters change
- CONFIG FILE/BUGFIX: RetroArch no longer crashes when attempting to save a config file after 'unsetting' a parameter (currently, this can be triggered quite easily by manipulating input remaps)
- CONFIG FILE/BUGFIX: When using Material UI, RetroArch no longer modifies the wrong setting (or segfaults...) when tapping entries in the Quick Menu > Controls input remapping submenu
- CONFIG FILE/BUGFIX: Quite a few real and potential memory leaks have been fixed.
- CHD: Fixes a crash caused by ignoring the return value from one of the CHD library functions
- FASTFORWARDING: A new Mute When Fast-Forwarding option has been added under Settings > Audio. When enabled, users can fast forward without having to listen to distorted audio.
- GLCORE/SLANG: Set filter and wrap mode correctly when intialising shader textures. Before, the glcore shader driver did not correctly initialise loaded textures. The texture filtering and wrap mode were forced on texture creation, but these settings were not recorded - subsequent updates would set garbage values, that would resolve to linear filtering OFF and wrap mode = CLAMP_TO_EDGE.
- LOCALIZATION: Update Japanese translation
- LOCALIZATION: Update Spanish translation
- LOCALIZATION: Update Portuguese Brazilian translation
- IOS: Set audio session category to ambient so sound does not get cut off on interruption (phone call/playing back audio)
- MAC/IOHIDMANAGER/BUGFIX: Fix for Mayflash N64 adapter. In case last hatswitch does not match cookie. For the mayflash N64 adapter, I was getting a BAD EXC ADDRESS (in mac OS 10.13) for this line (tmp was NULL). Retroarch would crash in the gui if I pressed a button from the DPAD on controller 2. With this change, it no longer crashes in the gui and still registers the button push.
- MAC/COCOA: Fix mouse input - this brings back two lines of code that have been removed over time but
appear to be required in order for mouse input to work on macOS
- METAL/BUGFIX: GPU capture on Metal/OSX/NVidia could crash
- METAL/BUGFIX: Taking screenshots could capture black frames. Resulting PNG screenshots were black.

- MENU/OZONE: Enable second thumbnail/content metadata toggle using RetroPad 'select'
- MENU/OZONE: Refactor footer display
- MENU/OZONE: Hide thumbnail button hints when viewing file browser lists
- MENU/OZONE/INPUT/BUGFIX: Fix undefined behaviour when using touch screen to change input remaps
- MENU/OZONE/INPUT/BUGFIX: It turns out that Windows reports negative pointer coordinates when the mouse cursor goes beyond the left hand edge of the RetroArch window (this doesn't happen on Linux, so I never encountered this issue before!). As a result, if Ozone is currently not showing the sidebar (menu depth > 1), moving the cursor off the left edge of the window generates a false positive 'cursor in sidebar' event - which breaks menu navigation, as described in #10419. With this PR, we now handle 'cursor in sidebar' status correctly in all cases
- MENU/OZONE/INPUT/BUGFIX: Pointer input is now correctly disabled when message boxes are displayed
- MENU/XMB: Fix thumbnail switching via 'scan' button functionality
- ODROID GO ADVANCE: Add DRM HW context driver
- PSL1GHT: Initial port
- PSL1GHT/KEYBOARD: Implement PSL1GHT keyboard
- PLAYLIST/BUGFIX: Improve handling of 'broken' playlists - RetroArch will no longer segfault when attempting to run content via a playlist entry with missing path or core path fields.
- PLAYLIST/BUGFIX: Improve handling of 'broken' playlists - when a playlist entry has either core path and/or core name set to NULL, DETECT or an empty string, attempting to load content will fallback to the normal 'core selection' code (currently this happens only if both core path and core name are DETECT - this is wholly inadequate!)
- PLAYLIST/BUGFIX: RetroArch will no longer segfault when attempting to fetch content runtime information when core path is NULL
- PLAYLIST/BUGFIX: Core name + runtime info will only be displayed on playlists and in the Information submenu if both the core path and core name fields are 'valid' (i.e. not NULL or DETECT)
- PLAYLIST/BUGFIX: When handling entries with missing path fields, the menu sorting order now matches that of the playlist sorting order (at present, everything goes out of sync when paths are empty). Moreover, entries with missing path fields can now be 'selected', so users can remove them (currently, hitting A on such an entry immediately tries - and fails - to load the content, so the only way to remove the broken entry is via the Playlist Management > Clean Playlist feature)
- PLAYLIST: Add optional per-playlist alphabetical sorting
- PLAYLIST: Omit whitespace when writing compressed JSON format playlists
- PLAYLIST: Add optional playlist compression
- QNX: Support analog sticks
- SAVESTATES: Add optional save state compression (enabled by default now)
- SRAM: Add optional save (SRAM) file compression

- TASKS/BUGFIX: Fix task deadlocks
- TASKS/SCREENSHOT/BUGFIX: Fix heap-use-after-free error when widgets are disabled
- TVOS: Disable overlays for tvOS, fix app icon
- VIDEO/WIDGETS/BUGFIX: The font ascender/descender metrics added in #10375 are now used to achieve 'pixel perfect' vertical text alignment
- VIDEO/WIDGETS/BUGFIX: Message queue text now uses its own dedicated font. Previously, a single (larger) font was used for all active widgets, and this was scaled down for message queue items. This 'squished' the text a little; more importantly, when using the stb font renderers (on Android. etc.) it caused ugly artefacts around the edges of glyphs due to pixel interpolation errors. Now that a correctly sized font is used, the message queue is always rendered cleanly.
- VIDEO/WIDGETS/BUGFIX: Previously, each widget font was 'flushed' (font_driver_flush()) at least once a frame. This is quite a slow operation. Now we only flush fonts if they have actually been used.
- VULKAN/BUGFIX: Fix display of statistics text
- UNIX/BUGFIX: Fix overflow when computing total memory on i386
- WIIU/BUGFIX: Fix font driver horizontal text alignment
- WIIU/BUGFIX: Fix non-vertex coordinates in draws using tex shader
- WIIU/BUGFIX: Update and fix meta.xml file for the WiiU release. This change makes it so the information from the meta.xml file parsed for the WiiU's Homebrew Launcher is displayed properly.

# 1.8.5
- 3DS: Keep the bottom screen hidden on sleep/wakeup. When the 3DS wakes back up after being closed, the bottom screen needs to be reinitialized. Adding the condition here will cause the screen to be turned on or off based on the state of ctr_bottom_screen_enabled, as you'd expect

- MENU/OZONE/POINTER: Cursor focus follows mouse pointer from sidebar to entries list (and vice versa)
- MENU/OZONE/POINTER: In entries list, item under cursor is automatically selected (with some fudging to ensure this doesn't break mouse wheel scrolling)
- MENU/OZONE/POINTER: In sidebar, item under cursor is not automatically selected (this is too jarring)
- MENU/RGUI: Add 'Flux' theme
- MENU/XMB: New color themes 'Cube Purple', 'Family Red', etc

- WIFI/CONNMANCTL: Display more characters from SSID

# 1.8.4
- ANDROID/BUGFIX: Prevent crash when Android device is minimized and you go back to the app
- CAMERA/BUGFIX: Fix crash when a core requires the camera driver and the platform only has a null driver. This would crash mgba on Wii for example
- DISK CONTROL: Cycle Disk Tray now becomes Eject Disk or Insert Disk depending upon current drive state
- DISK CONTROL: Current Disk Index is only shown when the current disk has been ejected
- DISK CONTROL: The old Insert Disk entry has been changed to Load New Disk, and is only shown when a disk is currently inserted (this is because loading a new disk from the filesystem - i.e. bypassing the m3u playlist disk index interface - automatically ejects and inserts disks, and so cannot be done while the virtual drive is empty)
- DISK CONTROL: The Current Disk Index may now be set more easily via a drop-down list.
- DISK CONTROL: Selecting Eject Disk automatically moves the menu selection to the Current Disk Index entry
- DISK CONTROL: Selecting an index via the Current Disk Index drop-down list automatically moves the menu selection back to Insert Disk
- DISK CONTROL: The Disk Control entry sublabels have been changed for greater clarity
- DISK CONTROL: All of the horrendous notification spam has been removed. Notifications are now only shown in the event of an error, or when the menu itself does not provide sufficient visual feedback (note that using hotkeys to swap disks still produces the old style notifications, since this is typically only done while content is running - i.e. no menu). The duration of disk-related info notifications has also been reduced to a more sane level.
- DISK CONTROL: A new Resume content after changing disks option has been added under Settings > User Interface. When enabled (default setting), content is resumed automatically after selecting either Insert Disk or Load New Disk (when disabled, the menu remains open, obviously...)
- DISK CONTROL/BUGFIX: The Disk Control menu now has the correct title
- DISK CONTROL/BUGFIX: Selecting a disk via the Load New Disk file browser no longer flushes the user back to the top level menu (it now correctly returns to the Disk Control menu)
- LIBNX/SWITCH: Updated libnx integration to v3.0.0. This also cherry-picks libnx commit 583d6bb92dcbb33b6bb4a0fa1a9df6e3725d6ef6, which should fix the requirement having to turn rumble off and on in the system settings once per reboot
- PLAYLISTS: Add 'Clean Playlist' option

# 1.8.3
- ANDROID/BUGFIX: Fix 'Install or Restore Core' regression

- NETPLAY/RELAY: Overall stability has improved. Fixed a memory leak that would cause the relay server to become unresponsive after some time.
- NETPLAY/RELAY: Fixed critical bug that would cause all players to be disconnected from the relay server if one player was leaving the game. That bug had been open for one year and we were finally able to fix it.
- SWITCH/LIBNX/BUGFIX: Fix onscreen keyboard input regression
- THUMBNAIL UPDATER: When waiting for individual thumbnail file http transfers to complete, the task status checking is more accurate. This uses the same method as the new core updater - we now wait until the task is 'really' complete, instead of relying on the (slightly nebulous) 'task finished' state
- UWP: Add ANGLE support
- UWP: Wire up get_metrics to the fake context of D3D9/10/11/12 driver, enabling proper scaling and mouse/touch gestures

- EMSCRIPTEN: Changes to support upgraded emscripten SDK
- FFMPEG CORE: Hardware accelerated video decoding
- FFMPEG CORE: Implement send/receive encoding API, will allow for hardware accelerated AMD video encoding
- FFMPEG CORE: The video FIFO can be removed, since we have a ring buffer in its place. This removes unneeded copy operations and as a positive side improves overall decoding speed. Makes 8k60p SW and 4k60p HW decoding feasible on many systems. For now the ring buffer is 32 images deep. This limitation will be removed, once audio and video decoder have their own packet handling.
- INPUT: Fix 'Analog stick controls menu even if autoconfig disabled'
- INPUT/TURBO: Added alternate Turbo-Mode 'Single Button' - For systems supporting only a single button, the turbo-button will toggle firing that button without the need to hold it.

- MENU/USABILITY: Add Audio -> Resampler settings
- MENU/USABILITY: Add Audio -> Output and Audio -> Synchronization
- OPENGL: Shaders are now working properly (only in OpenGL) when rotating both from Core API rotation and from menu video rotation. The fix is clearly visible with crt-royale for example
- OPENGL: 1:1 PAR is now correct when rotating (both from Core API rotation and from menu video rotation, as you said, in the latter case you currently have to change Aspect Ratio after menu video rotation for it to work)
- OPENGL: When using Custom Aspect Ratio and rotation (both from Core API rotation and from menu video rotation), Integer Scaling is now working properly (correct multiples of internal resolution). Even when Integer Scaling is not activated, the Custom AR width / height are now correctly labeled using (1x), (2x), ... suffixes. You also have to activate Integer Scaling after menu video rotation for it to work
- OPENGL: For all other Aspect Ratio options, Integer Scaling and rotation (both from Core API rotation and from menu video rotation) are now working properly together (correct multiples of internal resolution). You also have to activate Integer Scaling after menu video rotation for it to work

- VULKAN/ANDROID: Workaround weird WSI return codes in landscape mode -  Android WSI wants you to use preTransform, and if it is not used correctly, Android 10 will return VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR, and we would create a new swapchain every frame. This workaround just ignores this error, since it's not really an error. A more "proper" fix is to use prerotate and modify the MVP matrices,
which might help certain devices with crummy display processors
- VULKAN/ANDROID: Recreate swapchain on orientation change. ANativeWindow getWidth/Height does not detect any changes when using
Vulkan, so use the old onContentRectChanged callback to get notified when size changed. Use those values instead when figuring out how large swapchain to create
- WINDOWS/XINPUT: Get rid of 128 byte device name limit for XInput device discover - when device name was too long, it would not be picked up by the XInput driver and would instead fallback to DirectInput

- MENU/MATERIALUI: Two new context-sensitive buttons have been added to the navigation bar - back button and resume button
- MENU/MATERIALUI: A new Auto-Rotate Navigation Bar option has been added under User Interface > Appearance. When enabled (this is the default setting), the navigation bar is moved to the right hand side of the screen when using landscape screen orientations.

- SHADERS: Allow saving of shader presets based on the parent directory (Saving one for */foo/bar/mario.sfc* would result in *shaders/presets/corename/bar.ext*). We decided it's safer to still isolate the presets to a single core because different cores may treat video output differently
- SHADERS: Don't save the path to the current preset to the main config. This was causing weird behavior, instead it will try to load *currentconfig.ext* and it will save a preset with that name when select *apply shader preset*. The resulting shader will restore properly after restarting and even after core/parent/game specific presets are loaded
