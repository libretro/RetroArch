The aspect ratio is set to the full window area, so that the viewport spans the whole viewport. When using a border type shader like the Mega Bezel this allows the graphics to span the whole window regardless of the user's monitor aspect ratio

- AUDIO/ALSA: Fix float format detection
- AUDIO/JACK: Deinterleave in the process callback. This allows us to avoid the extra copy to the deinterleave buffer and lets us use only a single jack ringbuffer.

- D3D11: Should now be able to use shaders with hardware-accelerated libretro cores
- D3D11: Skip shader/stock blend when we don't have a texture. This happens if the core calls video_cb with the frame set to null on
the first frame, and was causing black screens/driver resets. The ffmpeg core seems to do this.
- D3D11: Fix shaders with scaled framebuffers
- D3D11: Add flip model support - fallback to blit model for OSes where flip model is not supported (windows 7 and earlier). Will add a menu option later allowing the user to switch inbetween the two

- FONTS/FREETYPE: Use fontconfig to select fonts if available
- INPUT: Add hold mode for turbo fire 'Single Button'
- INPUT MAPPING: Refresh bind list on device type change
- INPUT MAPPING/REMAPPING: Minor bugfix - Remap file browsing starts navigation at input_remapping_directory even if the core-subdir (where saved files go) exists
Having remaps for many different cores makes finding the active core files cumbersome, especially because remaps are not compatible between different cores (but maybe for cores emulating the same hardware)

- NETWORK: Fix backwards condition in socket blocking behavior
- NETWORK/NETPLAY: Attempt IPv4 when IPv6 fails
- OGA/VIDEO: support for OGS
- OGA: This keeps the tradition DRM driver along with the OGA one. The probe
function skips the driver if the screen is non rotated to fall back to
the regular DRM driver.
- OGA: Fix messages from not disappearing
- OGA: Implement RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_GET_CURRENT_SOFTWARE_FRAMEBUFFER. This is a faster rendering codepath for software rendered libretro cores that some libretro cores use right now. Video drivers in RetroArch have to explicitly implement this for this codepath to work at runtime.
- OPENDINGUX: Add/Optimise rumble interface
- OPENDINGUX: Fix frozen video when enabling fast forward
- OPENDINGUX/SDL: OSD font clean-up
- OPENDINGUX/SDL: Enable selection of image interpolation method when using 'sdl_dingux' gfx driver
- OPENDINGUX/SDL: Enable integer scaling when using the 'sdl_dingux' gfx driver
- OVERLAYS: Add option to scale overlays automatically (with aspect ratio correction)
- OVERLAYS: Hide Overlay When Gamepad is Connected. Overlays will be hidden automatically when a gamepad is connected in port 1, and shown again when the gamepad is disconnected.
- OVERLAYS: New default overlays for mobile (neo-retropad)
- OVERLAYS: In addition to overlay scale, the user can now set an Overlay Aspect Adjustment factor. Most overlays are designed for 16:9 displays, which means they become stretched/ugly on modern wide aspect phones and suchlike. By changing the Overlay Aspect Adjustment factor, a user can scale the overlay width/height to achieve a uniform appearance regardless of display resolution.
- OVERLAYS: Since scaling a gamepad overlay can result in buttons being squished too close together (or being pulled too far apart), the user can now adjust the effective spacing of the different 'halves' of an overlay via Overlay Horizontal Separation and Overlay Vertical Separation factors. Overlay Horizontal Separation divides the overlay in two vertically (left/right, at the centre point), and applies a spacing offset (positive or negative) between the UI elements on each side; Overlay Vertical Separation does the same, but the split is horizontal (top/bottom)
- OVERLAYS/FIX: The Overlay X Offset and Overlay Y Offset options have been fixed, and now work correctly
- OVERLAYS/FIX: All of the above options (and Overlay Scale) are configured and saved independently for landscape and portrait display orientations - so adjusting everything for a nice landscape layout won't break the portrait display
- OVERLAYS/FIX: When using the Vulkan gfx driver, memory is leaked every time an overlay is freed
- OVERLAYS/FIX: When threaded video is enabled, loading overlays with no images (i.e. utility-type overlays, where everything is hidden until the screen is touched) can generate segfaults due to improper usage of realloc()
- OVERLAYS/FIX: When Show Inputs on Overlay is enabled, ASAN reports bit shift errors due to an incorrect range check when handling turbo inputs - essentially, there is no upper limit to the considered input id range, which means overlay hotkeys (menu toggle, etc.) are incorrectly treated as having turbo support, causing bit shifts using wildly inappropriate id indices
- PLAYLISTS/PORTABLE: Fixed first load initialization
- PS2: Added Multitap support (up to 8 players)
- PS2: Fix for not recognized digital and other non-standard controllers

- SENSORS:  Android (crash-)fixes/improvements + add option to disable sensor input
- SDL2/VIDEO: Get the SDL2 video driver to work in Wayland/KMS
- SAVESTATES: Adding savestate garbage collector for autoincrement stavestates. As some issues indicate, there's an issue with
the autoincrement save slot feature: slot index will increase and very old saves won't be deleted. This adds support to delete old save states with a user defined
save state limit (global). Instead of wrapping around the slot counter it will simply delete the oldest save, since it is simpler. For now there's a limit of one deletion per save, which ensures a user cannot delete many saves by accident if they set the limit too low.
- SAVESTATES/SAVEFILES: Ensure save file and playlist compression is disabled by default
- SHADERS: Add option to remember last selected shader preset/shader pass directories
- SHADERS: Use last selected shader preset directory when changing shaders via previous/next hotkeys

- VITA: Disable temporarily VitaGL
- VITA: Fix bubble name
- VITA: proper handling of boot params
- VITA: Default menu scale 1.5x to improve readability
- WIFI/LAKKA: Add a proper WiFi menu, with Enable/Disable & Disconnect options. This also allows WiFi passwords to be remembered. The underlying tool (connman) allows to store passswords (that's why it auto connects whenever you boot a Lakka device), so we expose this so that the user does not have to re-input the pass when connecting to a saved wifi.
- WII/HID: Added HID support for HORI mini wired ps4 gamepad
- WINDOWS: Add support for accelerators to main win32 message loop
- WINDOWS: Add accelerators for Open (Ctrl+O) and Fullscreen (Alt+Enter)

- WIIU: Fix touchscreen mouse emulation

# 1.9.0
- 3DS: Fix sound crackling when paused
- ANDROID/VIBRATION: Fixes "Vibrate on Key Press" having no effect on Android devices, which occurred because only the off time/strength was defined in what should have been a pair of off/on values

- CHEEVOS: Fix 'Auto Save State freezes RetroArch while Cheevos is enabled'
- CORE OPTIONS: Pressing OK (or clicking/tapping) on a 'boolean toggle' core option no longer opens a drop-down list. The value now toggles directly, just like boolean options everywhere else in the menu
- CORE OPTIONS: Toggling an option that changes the number of core options being displayed (i.e. things like `Show Advanced Audio/Video Settings) no longer resets the navigation pointer to the start of the list
- CORE OPTIONS: Before, RetroArch would identify core option values as being 'boolean' if they had labels matching the specific strings enabled or disabled. Most core devs would abide by this, but not always... As a result, we sometimes would end up with misidentified values, with all kinds of Enabled, Off, True, etc. strings littering the menu, in place of proper toggle switches. All boolean-type value labels are now detected, and replaced with standard ON/OFF strings.
- CLI: A new command line option --load-menu-on-error has been added

# 1.8.9
- AUTO SAVESTATES: Ensure save states are correctly flushed to disk when quitting RetroArch (fixes broken save states when exiting RetroArch - without first closing content - with 'Auto Save State' enabled)
- BUILTIN CORES: Builtin cores like ffmpeg and imageviewer would previously try  to erroneously load a dynamic core named 'builtin' - this would fail and would just be a wasteful operation - this now skips dylib loading in libretro_get_system_info for builtin cores

# 1.8.7
- 3DS: Add IDs for Frodo
- 3DS: Enable basic networking / cheevos
- CHEEVOS/BUGFIX: Opening achievements list would crash RetroArch with badges enabled (on new games)
- CHEEVOS: Option to start a session with all achievements active

# 1.8.6
- 3DS: Add IDs for UZEM, TGB Dual, and NeoCD
- 3DS: Fix font driver horizontal text alignment
- 3DS: Allow button presses up to INPUT_MAX_USERS - this enables the 3DS to bind and use buttons and axis for users up to the maximum set by 'Max Users' in the input settings menu.
- 3DS: Disable video filter if upscaled resolution exceeds hardware limits. The 3DS has a maximum video buffer size of 2048x2048. This is sufficient for every core that it supports, but when using software video filters the core output resolution is doubled. This is made worse by the fact that the video filter upscaling buffer size is dependent upon the maximum output resolution of the core - which in some cases is very large indeed (e.g. pcsx-rearmed sets a maximum width of 1024, for enhanced resolution support). The 3DS has very limited 'linear memory' for graphics buffer purposes, and a large base core buffer + video filter buffer can easily exceed this - which may also disable video output, or cause a crash. This PR very simply adds a 3DS-specific check to the video filter initialisation: if the resultant upscaling buffer exceeds the hardware limitation, then the filter is automatically disabled.
- 3DS/FONT/BUGFIX: Text colour was wrong: the RGBA channels were muddled, and R was always set to 255
- 3DS/FONT/BUGFIX: When drawing multiline strings, the line spacing was completely incorrect
- 3DS/FONT: Improves the appearance of the drop shadow effect on notification text.
- 3DS/ARCHIVE/7Z: Re-enable 7zip support.
- ARCHIVE/ZIP: Expand functionality of 'rzip_stream' interface. This PR expands the functionality of the new rzip_stream archived stream interface such that it now has almost complete feature parity with the standard file_stream interface, and can therefore be used as a drop-in replacement in most situations
- AI SERVICE: Hide redundant entries when service is disabled
- AI SERVICE: Added in auto-translate support
- AI SERVICE: support for NVDA and SAPI narration

- CHEEVOS/BUGFIX: Prevent null reference rendering achievement list while closing application
- CHEEVOS/BUGFIX: Report non-memorymap GBA cores as unsupported
- COMMANDLINE: Advise against using -s and -S variables on the command line. …
- CONFIG FILE: Only write config files to disk when parameters change
- CONFIG FILE/BUGFIX: RetroArch no longer crashes when attempting to save a config file after 'unsetting' a parameter (currently, this can be triggered quite easily by manipulating input remaps)
- CONFIG FILE/BUGFIX: When using Material UI, RetroArch no longer modifies the wrong setting (or segfaults...) when tapping entries in the Quick Menu > Controls input remapping submenu
- CONFIG FILE/BUGFIX: Quite a few real and potential memory leaks have been fixed.
- CHD: Fixes a crash caused by ignoring the return value from one of the CHD library functions
- FASTFORWARDING: A new Mute When Fast-Forwarding option has been added under Settings > Audio. When enabled, users can fast forward without having to listen to distorted audio.
- GLCORE/SLANG: Set filter and wrap mode correctly when intialising shader textures. Before, the glcore shader driver did not correctly initialise loaded textures. The texture filtering and wrap mode were forced on texture creation, but these settings were not recorded - subsequent updates would set garbage values, that would resolve to linear filtering OFF and wrap mode = CLAMP_TO_EDGE.
- LOCALIZATION: Update Japanese translation
- LOCALIZATION: Update Spanish translation
- LOCALIZATION: Update Portuguese Brazilian translation
- IOS: Set audio session category to ambient so sound does not get cut off on interruption (phone call/playing back audio)
- MAC/IOHIDMANAGER/BUGFIX: Fix for Mayflash N64 adapter. In case last hatswitch does not match cookie. For the mayflash N64 adapter, I was getting a BAD EXC ADDRESS (in mac OS 10.13) for this line (tmp was NULL). Retroarch would crash in the gui if I pressed a button from the DPAD on controller 2. With this change, it no longer crashes in the gui and still registers the button push.
- MAC/COCOA: Fix mouse input - this brings back two lines of code that have been removed over time but
appear to be required in order for mouse input to work on macOS
- METAL/BUGFIX: GPU capture on Metal/OSX/NVidia could crash
- METAL/BUGFIX: Taking screenshots could capture black frames. Resulting PNG screenshots were black.

- MENU/OZONE: Refactor footer display
- MENU/OZONE: Hide thumbnail button hints when viewing file browser lists
- MENU/OZONE/INPUT/BUGFIX: Fix undefined behaviour when using touch screen to change input remaps
- MENU/OZONE/INPUT/BUGFIX: It turns out that Windows reports negative pointer coordinates when the mouse cursor goes beyond the left hand edge of the RetroArch window (this doesn't happen on Linux, so I never encountered this issue before!). As a result, if Ozone is currently not showing the sidebar (menu depth > 1), moving the cursor off the left edge of the window generates a false positive 'cursor in sidebar' event - which breaks menu navigation, as described in #10419. With this PR, we now handle 'cursor in sidebar' status correctly in all cases
- MENU/OZONE/INPUT/BUGFIX: Pointer input is now correctly disabled when message boxes are displayed
- MENU/XMB: Fix thumbnail switching via 'scan' button functionality
- ODROID GO ADVANCE: Add DRM HW context driver
- PSL1GHT: Initial port
- PSL1GHT/KEYBOARD: Implement PSL1GHT keyboard
- PLAYLIST/BUGFIX: Improve handling of 'broken' playlists - RetroArch will no longer segfault when attempting to run content via a playlist entry with missing path or core path fields.
- PLAYLIST/BUGFIX: Improve handling of 'broken' playlists - when a playlist entry has either core path and/or core name set to NULL, DETECT or an empty string, attempting to load content will fallback to the normal 'core selection' code (currently this happens only if both core path and core name are DETECT - this is wholly inadequate!)
- PLAYLIST/BUGFIX: RetroArch will no longer segfault when attempting to fetch content runtime information when core path is NULL
- PLAYLIST/BUGFIX: Core name + runtime info will only be displayed on playlists and in the Information submenu if both the core path and core name fields are 'valid' (i.e. not NULL or DETECT)
- PLAYLIST/BUGFIX: When handling entries with missing path fields, the menu sorting order now matches that of the playlist sorting order (at present, everything goes out of sync when paths are empty). Moreover, entries with missing path fields can now be 'selected', so users can remove them (currently, hitting A on such an entry immediately tries - and fails - to load the content, so the only way to remove the broken entry is via the Playlist Management > Clean Playlist feature)
- PLAYLIST: Add optional per-playlist alphabetical sorting
- PLAYLIST: Omit whitespace when writing compressed JSON format playlists
- PLAYLIST: Add optional playlist compression
- QNX: Support analog sticks
- SAVESTATES: Add optional save state compression (enabled by default now)

- TASKS/BUGFIX: Fix task deadlocks
- TASKS/SCREENSHOT/BUGFIX: Fix heap-use-after-free error when widgets are disabled
- TVOS: Disable overlays for tvOS, fix app icon
- VIDEO/WIDGETS/BUGFIX: The font ascender/descender metrics added in #10375 are now used to achieve 'pixel perfect' vertical text alignment
- VIDEO/WIDGETS/BUGFIX: Message queue text now uses its own dedicated font. Previously, a single (larger) font was used for all active widgets, and this was scaled down for message queue items. This 'squished' the text a little; more importantly, when using the stb font renderers (on Android. etc.) it caused ugly artefacts around the edges of glyphs due to pixel interpolation errors. Now that a correctly sized font is used, the message queue is always rendered cleanly.
- VIDEO/WIDGETS/BUGFIX: Previously, each widget font was 'flushed' (font_driver_flush()) at least once a frame. This is quite a slow operation. Now we only flush fonts if they have actually been used.
- VULKAN/BUGFIX: Fix display of statistics text
- UNIX/BUGFIX: Fix overflow when computing total memory on i386
- WIIU/BUGFIX: Fix font driver horizontal text alignment
- WIIU/BUGFIX: Fix non-vertex coordinates in draws using tex shader
- WIIU/BUGFIX: Update and fix meta.xml file for the WiiU release. This change makes it so the information from the meta.xml file parsed for the WiiU's Homebrew Launcher is displayed properly.

# 1.8.5
- 3DS: Keep the bottom screen hidden on sleep/wakeup. When the 3DS wakes back up after being closed, the bottom screen needs to be reinitialized. Adding the condition here will cause the screen to be turned on or off based on the state of ctr_bottom_screen_enabled, as you'd expect

- MENU/OZONE/POINTER: In entries list, item under cursor is automatically selected (with some fudging to ensure this doesn't break mouse wheel scrolling)
- MENU/OZONE/POINTER: In sidebar, item under cursor is not automatically selected (this is too jarring)
- MENU/RGUI: Add 'Flux' theme

- WIFI/CONNMANCTL: Display more characters from SSID

# 1.8.4
- ANDROID/BUGFIX: Prevent crash when Android device is minimized and you go back to the app
- CAMERA/BUGFIX: Fix crash when a core requires the camera driver and the platform only has a null driver. This would crash mgba on Wii for example
- DISK CONTROL: Cycle Disk Tray now becomes Eject Disk or Insert Disk depending upon current drive state
- DISK CONTROL: Current Disk Index is only shown when the current disk has been ejected
- DISK CONTROL: The old Insert Disk entry has been changed to Load New Disk, and is only shown when a disk is currently inserted (this is because loading a new disk from the filesystem - i.e. bypassing the m3u playlist disk index interface - automatically ejects and inserts disks, and so cannot be done while the virtual drive is empty)
- DISK CONTROL: The Current Disk Index may now be set more easily via a drop-down list.
- DISK CONTROL: Selecting Eject Disk automatically moves the menu selection to the Current Disk Index entry
- DISK CONTROL: Selecting an index via the Current Disk Index drop-down list automatically moves the menu selection back to Insert Disk
- DISK CONTROL: The Disk Control entry sublabels have been changed for greater clarity
- DISK CONTROL: All of the horrendous notification spam has been removed. Notifications are now only shown in the event of an error, or when the menu itself does not provide sufficient visual feedback (note that using hotkeys to swap disks still produces the old style notifications, since this is typically only done while content is running - i.e. no menu). The duration of disk-related info notifications has also been reduced to a more sane level.
- DISK CONTROL: A new Resume content after changing disks option has been added under Settings > User Interface. When enabled (default setting), content is resumed automatically after selecting either Insert Disk or Load New Disk (when disabled, the menu remains open, obviously...)
- DISK CONTROL/BUGFIX: The Disk Control menu now has the correct title
- DISK CONTROL/BUGFIX: Selecting a disk via the Load New Disk file browser no longer flushes the user back to the top level menu (it now correctly returns to the Disk Control menu)
- LIBNX/SWITCH: Updated libnx integration to v3.0.0. This also cherry-picks libnx commit 583d6bb92dcbb33b6bb4a0fa1a9df6e3725d6ef6, which should fix the requirement having to turn rumble off and on in the system settings once per reboot
- PLAYLISTS: Add 'Clean Playlist' option

# 1.8.3
- ANDROID/BUGFIX: Fix 'Install or Restore Core' regression
- BUGFIX: Ensure core info is always initialised when calling 'drivers_init()'. This bug could prevent cores from doing content runtime logging
- BUGFIX/MENU: History size can only be set to 1 at a minimum
- BUGFIX/MENU: (XMB/OZONE) Fix 'quick menu' detection. XMB would not display savestate thumbnails in the quick menu if it was accessed via the main menu
- BUGFIX/CRASH/CORE UPDATER: Fix potential double free error
- BUGFIX/CRASH/OPENGL/WINDOWS: Fix regression in 1.8.2 that would cause GL-based cores to fail because it would try to erroneously load libGLESv2.dll instead of OpenGL32.dll (cores affected: VitaQuake 2/3/Dhewm3, possibly more)
- BUGFIX/MENU/DESKTOP UI: Show desktop menu on startup does not launch Qt UI on Linux
- BUGFIX: Entries in the Playlist Thumbnails Updater list were displaying improper sublabels. I have no idea when this broke... The issue is now fixed

- NETPLAY/RELAY: Add Sao Paulo (Brazil) relay server
- NETPLAY/RELAY: Fix the “spectator” bug when using the relay server – When a player switches into the spectator mode (pressing “i”) while using the relay server, all players will disconnect.
- NETPLAY/RELAY: Overall stability has improved. Fixed a memory leak that would cause the relay server to become unresponsive after some time.
- NETPLAY/RELAY: Fixed critical bug that would cause all players to be disconnected from the relay server if one player was leaving the game. That bug had been open for one year and we were finally able to fix it.
- SWITCH/LIBNX/BUGFIX: Fix onscreen keyboard input regression
- THUMBNAIL UPDATER: When waiting for individual thumbnail file http transfers to complete, the task status checking is more accurate. This uses the same method as the new core updater - we now wait until the task is 'really' complete, instead of relying on the (slightly nebulous) 'task finished' state
- UWP: Add ANGLE support
- UWP: Wire up get_metrics to the fake context of D3D9/10/11/12 driver, enabling proper scaling and mouse/touch gestures
- VITA: Re-add Online Updater
- VULKAN: Fix font driver 'vulkan_get_message_width()' function
- VIDEO FILTERS: Only use threads when the number exceeds 1. Fixes race conditions with some CPU filters on Vita
- WINDOWS: Add ANGLE support for x64, separate binary (for now?)

# 1.8.2
- BUG/CRASH/GLSLANG: Fix glslang crashing error - managed to reproduce an issue which has been plaguing
users for a while, where glslang throws an assert after closing a game (and starting a new one). This would affect all video drivers that use Slang for shaders, such as D3D10/11/12/Vulkan/Metal
- CHEEVOS: Display Unofficial and Unsupported achievement states
- CHEEVOS: Pass RetroArch and core versions through User-Agent HTTP header

- EMSCRIPTEN: Changes to support upgraded emscripten SDK
- FFMPEG CORE: Hardware accelerated video decoding
- FFMPEG CORE: Implement send/receive encoding API, will allow for hardware accelerated AMD video encoding
- FFMPEG CORE: The video FIFO can be removed, since we have a ring buffer in its place. This removes unneeded copy operations and as a positive side improves overall decoding speed. Makes 8k60p SW and 4k60p HW decoding feasible on many systems. For now the ring buffer is 32 images deep. This limitation will be removed, once audio and video decoder have their own packet handling.
- INPUT: Fix 'Analog stick controls menu even if autoconfig disabled'
- INPUT/TURBO: Added alternate Turbo-Mode 'Single Button' - For systems supporting only a single button, the turbo-button will toggle firing that button without the need to hold it. When holding the button turbo will be suspended and resumed when the button is released. Holding the button may have a different function to just tapping it.
- IOS: Forcibly disable Threaded Video until UIWindow concurrency issues are fixed
- INPUT/ANALOG: Fix radial analog deadzone scaling

- OPENGL: Shaders are now working properly (only in OpenGL) when rotating both from Core API rotation and from menu video rotation. The fix is clearly visible with crt-royale for example
- OPENGL: 1:1 PAR is now correct when rotating (both from Core API rotation and from menu video rotation, as you said, in the latter case you currently have to change Aspect Ratio after menu video rotation for it to work)
- OPENGL: When using Custom Aspect Ratio and rotation (both from Core API rotation and from menu video rotation), Integer Scaling is now working properly (correct multiples of internal resolution). Even when Integer Scaling is not activated, the Custom AR width / height are now correctly labeled using (1x), (2x), ... suffixes. You also have to activate Integer Scaling after menu video rotation for it to work
- OPENGL: For all other Aspect Ratio options, Integer Scaling and rotation (both from Core API rotation and from menu video rotation) are now working properly together (correct multiples of internal resolution). You also have to activate Integer Scaling after menu video rotation for it to work

- VULKAN/ANDROID: Workaround weird WSI return codes in landscape mode -  Android WSI wants you to use preTransform, and if it is not used correctly, Android 10 will return VK_SUBOPTIMAL_KHR, and we would create a new swapchain every frame. This workaround just ignores this error, since it's not really an error. A more "proper" fix is to use prerotate and modify the MVP matrices,
which might help certain devices with crummy display processors
- VULKAN/ANDROID: Recreate swapchain on orientation change. ANativeWindow getWidth/Height does not detect any changes when using
Vulkan, so use the old onContentRectChanged callback to get notified when size changed. Use those values instead when figuring out how large swapchain to create
