 * Instead of managing input devices themselves,
 * cores need only to map their own concept of a controller to libretro's abstractions.
 * This makes it possible for frontends to map the abstract types to a real input device
 * without having to worry about the correct use of arbitrary (real) controller layouts.

/**

 * This allows libretro to query in absolute coordinates where on the
 * screen a mouse (or something similar) is being placed.
 * For a touch centric device, coordinates reported are the coordinates
 * of the press.
 *
 * Coordinates in X and Y are reported as:
 * [-0x7fff, 0x7fff]: -0x7fff corresponds to the far left/top of the screen,
 * and 0x7fff corresponds to the far right/bottom of the screen.
 * The "screen" is here defined as area that is passed to the frontend and
 * later displayed on the monitor.
 *
 * The frontend is free to scale/resize this screen as it sees fit, however,
 * (X, Y) = (-0x7fff, -0x7fff) will correspond to the top-left pixel of the
 * game image, etc.
 *
 * To check if the pointer coordinates are valid (e.g. a touch display
 * actually being touched), \c RETRO_DEVICE_ID_POINTER_PRESSED returns 1 or 0.
 *
 * If using a mouse on a desktop, \c RETRO_DEVICE_ID_POINTER_PRESSED will
 * usually correspond to the left mouse button, but this is a frontend decision.
 * \c RETRO_DEVICE_ID_POINTER_PRESSED will only return 1 if the pointer is
 * inside the game screen.
 *
 * For multi-touch, the index variable can be used to successively query
 * more presses.
 * If index = 0 returns true for \c _PRESSED, coordinates can be extracted
 * with \c _X, \c _Y for index = 0. One can then query \c _PRESSED, \c _X, \c _Y with
 * index = 1, and so on.
 * Eventually \c _PRESSED will return false for an index. No further presses
 * are registered at this point.

 *     shaped like musical instruments.
 * \li Representing variants of a standard controller with additional inputs.
 *     For example, numerous consoles in the 90's introduced 6-button controllers for fighting games,
 *     steering wheels for racing games,
 *     or analog sticks for 3D platformers.
 * \li Representing add-ons for consoles or standard controllers.
 *     For example, the 3DS had a Circle Pad Pro attachment that added a second analog stick.
 * \li Selecting different configurations for a single controller.
 *     For example, the Wii Remote could be held sideways like a traditional game pad

 * \li Providing multiple ways to simulate the experience of using a particular controller.

 * by RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_SET_CORE_OPTIONS_V2,
 * which supports categorizing options into groups.
 * This environment call should only be used to maintain compatibility
 * with older cores and frontends.
 *
 * This environment call is intended to replace \c RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_SET_VARIABLES,
 * and should only be called if \c RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_GET_CORE_OPTIONS_VERSION
 * returns an API version of at least 1.
 *
 * This should be called the first time as early as possible,
 * ideally in \c retro_set_environment (but \c retro_load_game is acceptable).
 * It may then be called again later to update
 * the core's options and their associated values,
 * as long as the number of options doesn't change
 * from the number given in the first call.
 *
 * The core can retrieve option values at any time with \c RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_GET_VARIABLE.
 * If a saved value for a core option doesn't match the option definition's values,
 * the frontend may treat it as incorrect and revert to the default.
 *
 * Core options and their values are usually defined in a large static array,
 * but they may be generated at runtime based on the loaded game or system state.
 * Here are some use cases for that:
 *
 * @li Selecting a particular file from one of the
 *     \ref RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_GET_ASSET_DIRECTORY "frontend's"
 *     \ref RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_GET_SAVE_DIRECTORY "content"
 *     \ref RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_GET_CORE_ASSETS_DIRECTORY "directories",
 *     such as a memory card image or figurine data file.
 * @li Excluding options that are not relevant to the current game,
 *     for cores that define a large number of possible options.
 * @li Choosing a default value at runtime for a specific game,
 *     such as a BIOS file whose region matches that of the loaded content.
 *
 * @note A guiding principle of libretro's API design is that
 * all common interactions (gameplay, menu navigation, etc.)
 * should be possible without a keyboard.
 * This implies that cores should keep the number of options and values
 * as low as possible.
 *

 * @code
 * {
 *     "foo_option",

 *     for cores that define a large number of possible options.
 * @li Choosing a default value at runtime for a specific game,
 *     such as a BIOS file whose region matches that of the loaded content.
 *
 * @note A guiding principle of libretro's API design is that

 * File paths passed to all libretro filesystem APIs shall be well formed UNIX-style,
 * using "/" (unquoted forward slash) as the directory separator
 * regardless of the platform's native separator.
 *
 * Paths shall also include at least one forward slash
 * (e.g. use "./game.bin" instead of "game.bin").
 *
 * Other than the directory separator, cores shall not make assumptions about path format.
 * The following paths are all valid:
 * @li \c C:/path/game.bin
 * @li \c http://example.com/game.bin
 * @li \c #game/game.bin
 * @li \c ./game.bin
 *
 * Cores may replace the basename or remove path components from the end, and/or add new components;
 * however, cores shall not append "./", "../" or multiple consecutive forward slashes ("//") to paths they request from the front end.
 *
 * The frontend is encouraged to do the best it can when given an ill-formed path,
 * but it is allowed to give up.
 *
 * Frontends are encouraged, but not required, to support native file system paths
 * (including replacing the directory separator, if applicable).
 *
 * Cores are allowed to try using them, but must remain functional if the frontend rejects such requests.
 *
 * Cores are encouraged to use the libretro-common filestream functions for file I/O,
 * as they seamlessly integrate with VFS,
 * deal with directory separator replacement as appropriate
 * and provide platform-specific fallbacks
 * in cases where front ends do not provide their own VFS interface.
