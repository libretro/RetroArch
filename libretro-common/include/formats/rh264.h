/* rh264 -- self-contained H.264 decoder for libretro-common.
 *
 * Decodes H.264 (AVC) I, P and B pictures with either entropy coding
 * (CAVLC and CABAC): NAL/SPS/PPS/slice parsing; 4x4, 8x8 and 16x16 luma
 * and chroma intra prediction; inter prediction with quarter-pel motion
 * compensation, multiple reference pictures (a DPB with sliding-window
 * and MMCO marking and reference list modifications), weighted and
 * implicit bi-prediction, and spatial and temporal direct modes; the
 * 4x4 and 8x8 integer transforms with scaling matrices and the Hadamard
 * DC transforms; dequantisation with correct chroma-QP derivation; the
 * in-loop deblocking filter; and picture order count types 0, 1 and 2
 * with display-order output.  Reconstruction is 8-bit 4:2:0 and 4:2:2,
 * which covers the baseline, main and high profiles as commonly emitted.
 *
 * Out-of-scope streams are refused at the parameter-set or slice level
 * rather than decoded wrongly: 4:4:4, monochrome, high bit depths and
 * lossless transform bypass; SP/SI switching slices; FMO/ASO and
 * redundant pictures; field-coded B and CABAC pictures and field-coded
 * macroblock pairs (frame-coded MBAFF pairs decode; field pictures
 * decode for CAVLC I/P).
 *
 * The CAVLC VLC tables are extracted verbatim from the encoder tables in
 * libopenh264 (verified prefix-free); no table is hand-transcribed.
 *
 * The persistent video API mirrors rvp8_video so a demuxer (e.g. the MP4
 * glue in rmp4_video.c) can dispatch H.264 exactly like it dispatches VP8/
 * VP9:
 *
 *   rh264_video *v = rh264_video_open();
 *   rh264_video_set_extradata(v, avcc, avcc_len);   (the avcC box payload)
 *   for each frame:
 *      if (rh264_video_decode(v, data, len) < 0) fail;   (1 = picture ready)
 *      y = rh264_video_plane(v, 0, &ystride, &w, &h);   (also 1=U, 2=V)
 *   rh264_video_close(v);
 *
 * Frame data may be either Annex-B (start-code delimited) or the
 * length-prefixed AVCC form carried in MP4 'mdat'; the NAL length size is
 * taken from the avcC extradata when present (default 4).  The returned
 * plane pointers stay valid until the next decode call. */
