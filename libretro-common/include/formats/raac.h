/* raac -- MPEG-4 AAC Low Complexity decoder (ISO/IEC 14496-3).
 *
 * Decodes raw AAC-LC access units as MP4 files carry them ('mp4a'
 * sample entries with object type 0x40, one raw_data_block per
 * sample; no ADTS framing).  The decoder is created from the
 * AudioSpecificConfig found in the esds DecoderSpecificInfo and
 * outputs interleaved signed 16-bit PCM, 1024 samples per channel
 * per access unit.
 *
 * Scope: AAC-LC (audioObjectType 2), the 1024- and 960-sample frame
 * lengths,
 * every standard sampling rate as well as explicitly coded ones
 * (samplingFrequencyIndex 15), channel configurations 1 through 7 and
 * configuration 0 with an embedded PCE, up to eight output channels,
 * M/S and intensity stereo, PNS, pulse data and TNS.  In-stream PCE
 * and DSE elements are parsed and skipped.  Coupling channel
 * elements are decoded and mixed into their targets, dependently or
 * independently switched, with up to four concurrent coupling tags.
 * Channels are emitted in element transmission order, which for the
 * standard configurations is the ISO order (e.g. 5.1: C, L, R, Ls,
 * Rs, LFE); no downmix or reordering is applied.  Not decoded (open
 * or decode fails cleanly): other object types (Main, SSR, LTP,
 * HE-AAC's explicit SBR signalling) and the 960-sample frame length.
 * Implicitly signalled SBR in fill elements is skipped, decoding the
 * LC core band, as plain LC decoders do.

 * The doubled rate turns on at open and never changes mid-stream:
 * either the configuration signals SBR explicitly (hierarchical or

 * 1024-frame stream has a core rate of 16-24 kHz, the range where

 * raac_sample_rate() always reports the rate the output is actually
 * at. High-frequency reconstruction is not synthesised yet, so
 * SBR-bearing streams currently decode as upsampled core audio.
 * HE-AAC v2 configurations open as v1: the parametric-stereo payload
 * is skipped and the SBR mono signal is decoded. Explicitly signaled
 * downsampled SBR (extension rate equal to the core rate) decodes as
 * plain LC at the core rate. Size output buffers from
