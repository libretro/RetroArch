## Guidelines

1. Rebase before opening a pull request
2. If you are sending several unrelated fixes or features, use a branch and a separate pull request for each
3. If possible try squashing everything in a single commit. This is particularly beneficial in the case of feature merges since it allows easy bisecting when a problem arises
4. RetroArch codebase follows C89 coding rules for portability across many old platforms check using `C89_BUILD=1`
