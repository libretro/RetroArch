- SCANNING: Fix for scanning PSP ISOs (and probably few others)
- SAVES: Fix core config saving
- SAVES: Fix save new config name when core loaded
- SAVESTATES: Increase save state chunk size for all platforms - Even a class 6 or class 10 SD card can handle reads and writes on the order of MB/s, which means a 4KB chunk size is just wasting time in syscalls.  This could maybe be fixed with a buffering reader but I don't feel comfortable tweaking libretro-common's VFS to handle that.  Instead, I thought it would be good to both remove an ifdef and increase the chunk size to 128KB.  For cores with small states this will should make state saving virtually instantaneous, and for cores with large states it should be a 32x speedup.

- UWP: Align MESA to alpha-2-resfix - Remove wrong resolution special handling for OPENGL
- UWP: 4K fix: align MESA reading of ClientRect to retroarch procedure, this fixes max resolution being set to 1080p. As reading must be done inside an UI thread and is in fact an async operation which might delay frame generation, the reading itself is doen once and cached, give that changing resolution while the app is running is an unlikely corner-case use

- SHADER: Added rolling scan line simulation based on the shader subframe feature. This is implemented with a scrolling scissor rect rather than in the shader itself as this is more efficient although may not work for every shader pass - we may need an option to exclude certain passes. The implementation simply divides the screen up by the number of sub frames and then moves the scissor rect down over the screen over the number of sub frames
