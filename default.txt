# 1.16.0
- 3DS: Update __system_initArgv
- 3DS: Update SquirrelJME 3DS Core information along with icons.

- AUDIO/PULSEAUDIO: Support device list for PulseAudio
- AUDIO/WASAPI: WASAPI Frame Delay fix + cleanups
- AUDIO/WASAPI/MIDI: Frame Delay correction
- ARCHIVE/ZIP: Improve ZIP decompression This reduces the amount of memory Retroarch needs to extract a ROM file. It will only need the size of the ROM plus 128KiB to extract the file from the ZIP. Previously it needed as much as twice that amount if the compression ratio was not great. This is useful on memory constrained platforms and has no impact on platforms with plenty of memory. Handles all cases correctly (with and without MMAP, for cores that require fullpath or not, small and big ZIP files).

- APPLE: Update to MoltenVK 1.2.4
- APPLE: Don't include MoltenVK library in Load Core menu list

- FRAMESKIP: Use refresh rate instead of core fps for frameskip timing
- INPUT: Combo hold + 'enable_hotkey' correction. Fixed issue with having menu toggle hold combo in different button than 'enable_hotkey', which caused 'enable_hotkey' to also act as menu toggle if held long enough, and simplified and unified duplicate code in start+select holds to a single function.
- INPUT: input_keyboard_event: Don't check hotkey binds when device is RETRO_DEVICE_POINTER
- INPUT: Add input_keymaps_translate_rk_to_ascii() for correct character input to input_keyboard_event
- INPUT: input_overlay_poll: Delay clearing INPUT_OVERLAY_BLOCKED flag until there is no overlay input (Avoids stray input after osk_toggle)
- INPUT: Send keyboard events for modifiers before other keys (for correct modifier+key input if hitboxes overlap)
- INPUT: Remember currently set keyboard mapping bits during same config read, because otherwise customized keybinds can get cleared out of the bits on the next iteration, causing keyboard events to get passed to the core when they should get blocked.
- INPUT/AUTOCONFIG: Reinit after updating autoconf profiles
- INPUT/LINUX/UDEV: Log mouse devices in info level
- INPUT/LINUX/UDEV: First working version of udev driver with touchscreen support and gestures.

- INPUT/OVERLAY: Revive/rewrite Keyboard Overlay and OSK Toggle. Add keyboard overlay preset, keyboard submenu, and osk_toggle hotkey. Use overlay caching for osk_toggle.
- INPUT/OVERLAY: Overlay Caching. Adds overlay_cache_ptr to keep a disabled overlay in memory when it's expected to be shown again. Most input_overlay_deinit calls are replaced with input_overlay_unload, which caches the overlay unless initing/deiniting core or disabling overlays. Loading a cached overlay is done as a swap, intended for osk_toggle.
- INPUT/OVERLAY: Add input_overlay_check_mouse_cursor() to preserve show/hide mouse behavior
- INPUT/OVERLAY: Don't apply input_overlay_show_mouse_cursor in windowed mode (controlled by mouse grab only)
