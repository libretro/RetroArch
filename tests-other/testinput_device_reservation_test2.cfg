# Test configuration file to be used with --appendconfig.
# Sets up joypad driver, test input file for the joypad driver,
# logging and autoconfig dir, and prevents saving.
# Usage:
#   retroarch --appendconfig tests-other/testinput_device_reservation_test2.cfg\|tests-other/all_binds_empty.cfg

# Test scenario:
# - Player 1 through 4 has preferred device C
# - Player 5 and 6 has no reserved device
# - Connect controller A, then B, then 4 instances of C
# - VALIDATE: check that Player 1 - C (1), Player 2 - C(2), Player 3 - C(3), Player 4 - C(4),
#                        Player 5 - A,     Player 6 - B
