Libsmb2 is a userspace client/server library for accessing or serving
SMB2/SMB3 shares on a network.
It is high performance and fully async. It supports both zero-copy
for SMB READ/WRITE commands as well as compounded commands.

Libsmb2 is distributed under the LGPLv2.1 licence.


API
===
Libsmb2 implements three different APIs for accessing remote SMB shares :

1, High level synchronous posix-like API:
This is a simple API for accessing a share.
The functions in this API are modelled to be be similar to the corresponding
POSIX functions.
This API is described in libsmb2.h

2, High level async posix-like API:
This is a high performance, fully non-blocking and async API.
The functions in this API are modelled to be be similar to the corresponding
POSIX functions.
This is the recommended API.
This API is described in libsmb2.h

3, Low level async RAW API:
This is a low level API that provides direct access to the SMB2 PDUs
and data structures.
This API is described in libsmb2-raw.h

Libsmb2 implements a synchronous API for running an SMB server. You could
run an async server if you implement the main loop yourself however

SMB URL Format
==============
The SMB URL format is currently a small subset of the URL format that is
defined/used by the Samba project.
The goal is to eventually support the full URL format, thus making URLs
interchangeable between Samba utilities and Libsmb2 but we are not there yet.

smb://[<domain>;][<user>@]<server>[:<port>]/<share>[/path][?arg=val[&arg=val]*]

<server> is either a hostname, an IPv4 or an IPv6 address.

Arguments supported by libsmb2 are :
 sec=<mech>    : Mechanism to use to authenticate to the server. Default
	         is any available mech, but can be overridden by :
		 krb5: Use Kerberos using credentials from kinit.
		 krb5cc: Use Kerberos using credentials from credentials
	                 cache.
		 ntlmssp : Only use NTLMSSP
 vers=<version> : Which SMB version to negotiate:
                  2: Negotiate any version of SMB2
                  3: Negotiate any version of SMB3
		  2.02, 2.10, 3.00, 3.02, 3.1.1 : negotiate a specific version.
		  Default is to negotiate any SMB2 or SMB3 version.
  seal          : Enable SMB3 encryption.
  sign          : Require SMB2/3 signing.
  timeout       : Timeout in seconds when to cancel a command.
                  Default it 0: No timeout.
  ndr32         : DCERPC: only offer NDR32 transfer syntax. (default)
  ndr64         : DCERPC: only offer NDR64 transfer syntax.
  ndr3264       : DCERPC: offer both NRD32 and NDR64 transfer syntax.
  le            : DCERPC: send PDUs in Little-Endian format
  be            : DCERPC: send PDUs in Big-Endian format
NOTE:-
	When using krb5cc mode use smb2_set_domain() and smb2_set_password() in the examples and applications

SMB Server
==========
There is an example server implementation in examples/smb2-server-sync.c. The library
server function is handed an array of function pointers that the library will call
for each client command. It is up to your implementation to fill out and return
replies for each according to your use. The example simulates a disk with a few files.
Your handler will be also be called to pre-authenticate users as part of ntlmssp (krb
authenticaton not yet implemented). Your application will also be called-back each
time a client connect to allow your to configure the context prior to negotiation.

Authentication
==============
Libsmb2 provides has builtin support for NTLMSSP username/password
authentication.
It can also, optionally, be built with (MIT) Kerberos authentication.

Libsmb2 will try to build with Kerberos if these libraries are present.
You can force a build without Kerberos support by using the flag
--without-libkrb5 to configure. In this case only NTLMSSP authentication
will be available.

MIT KERBEROS
============
Authentication is implemented using MIT Kerberos and it supports both KRB5
for authentication against Active Directory as well as NTLMSSP (optional).

MIT Kerberos can be configured to also provide NTLMSSP authentication,
as an alternative to the builtin NTLMSSP implementation using an
external mech plugin.
To use this Kerberos/NTLMSSP module you will need to build and install
GSS-NTLMSSP from [https://github.com/simo5/gss-ntlmssp]
If you are uncertain you can skip this module and just use the NTLMSSP
module that is provided by libsmb2.

NTLM Authentication
-------------------
NTLM credentials are stored in a text file of the form :
DOMAIN:USERNAME:PASSWORD
with one line per username.
You need to set up the environment variable NTLM_USER_FILE to point to this
file.
You need one entry in this file for each local user account you want to be able
to use libsmb2 for accessing a remote share.

By default, NTLM authentication will use the username for the current process.
This can be overridden by specifying a different username in the SMB URL :
  smb://guest@server/share?sec=ntlmssp

KRB5 Authentication
-------------------
Kerberos authentication can be used when the linux workstation as well as
the file server are part of Active Directory.

You should be able to authenticate to the file server using krb5
by specifying sec=krb5 in the URL :
  smb://server/share?sec=krb5

The application needs to set the username, password and the domain fqdn in the context using
smb2_set_user(), smb2_set_password() and smb2_set_domain() respectively.


NTLM Credentials
================
This applies to both the builtin NTLMSSP implementation as well as when
using Kerberos with the NTLMSSP mech plugin.

NTLM credentials are stored in a text file of the form :
DOMAIN:USERNAME:PASSWORD
with one line per username.
You need to set up the environment variable NTLM_USER_FILE to point to this
file.
You need one entry in this file for each local user account you want to be able
to use libsmb2 for accessing a remote share.

By default, NTLM authentication will use the username for the current process.
This can be overridden by specifying a different username in the SMB URL :
  smb://guest@server/share?sec=ntlmssp

Alternatively you can provide the username and password from your application
by calling :
  smb2_set_user(smb2, <username>);
  smb2_set_password(smb2, <password>);

(For server, you don't need to set the user, as that is supplied by the client)

SMB2/3 SIGNING
==============
Signing is supported with KRB5, with the builtin ntlmssp support and with
gss-ntlmssp mech plugin.

SMB3 Encryption
===============
Encryption is only supported with KRB5 or with the builtin ntlmssp support.
Encryption is not supported when the gss-ntlmssp mech plugin is used.
Encryption can be enabled either using the "seal" URL argument or by calling
  smb3_set_seal(smb2, 1);

BUILDING LIBSMB2
===============

 Windows
---------------------------

You have to install CMake (https://cmake.org/) and Visual Studio (https://www.visualstudio.com/)
to build libsmb2 for Windows (including Universal Windows Platform).

Please follow the next steps to build shared library:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" ..
	cmake --build . --config RelWithDebInfo

Static library: 

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=0 ..
	cmake --build . --config RelWithDebInfo

 macOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS
---------------------------

You can use AMSMB2 (https://github.com/amosavian/AMSMB2) universal framework 
which incorporates precompiled libsmb2 for Apple devices.

It is written in Swift but can be used in both Swift and Objective-C codes.

If you want to rebuild libsmb2 in AMSMB2, please follow these steps:

	git clone https://github.com/amosavian/AMSMB2
	cd AMSMB2/buildtools
	./build.sh

Precompiled binaries don't include Kerberos support by default.
If you want build libraries with Kerberos support, execute this script instead:

	./build-with-krb5.sh


ESP32
-----
libsmb2 is pre-configured for the ESP32 micro-controller using the esp-idf
toolchain (Arduino is not supported). Simply clone this project in the
'components' directory of the ESP32 project and it will automatically be
included in the build process.

Raspberry Pi Pico W (RP2040)
----------------------------
libsmb2 will compile on the RP2040 using gcc-arm-none-eabi, the pico-sdk
and FreeRTOS-Kernel. In examples/picow is a CMakeLists.txt that can be
edited to point at the pico-sdk and FreeRTOS-Kernel, and will then build
libsmb2 and a sample - this can be used as a starting point.  Inside
include/picow are some configuration files for lwip, FreeRTOS and any
applications built with libsmb2.  These can also be used as a starting 
point and adjusted as needed for your applications.

The only define needed for libsmb2 on the RP2040, other than the RP2040
defines such as PICO_BOARD=pico_w, is PICO_PLATFORM.
