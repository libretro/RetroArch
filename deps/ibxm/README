A good-quality player library for the ProTracker MOD music format
for Javascript (HTML5 Web Audio), Java, ANSI C (SDL) and Pascal (SDL).

Also hosted here is IBXM, a player library for the ProTracker MOD,
Scream Tracker 3 S3M, and FastTracker 2 XM music formats for Javascript
(HTML5 Web Audio), Java and ANSI C.

The Java version of Micromod contains a powerful command-line tool for
the creation of MOD files from textual MT files and WAV samples.
There is some basic documentation built-in to the tool and some example
MT files are contained in the songs directory. Some knowledge of the
ProTracker MOD format, audio synthesis and "tracking" is assumed.

Cheers,
