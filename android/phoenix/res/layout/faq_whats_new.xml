        r13 (May 26, 2013)\n\n
        * Threaded video option. Mainly for Android users but works for OpenGL driver in general.\n
        * (Android) Add iControlPad support.\n

        * (RGUI) RGUI now works on PC, Android, iOS and Blackberry - and is no longer Wii-exclusive.\n
        * (RGUI) RGUI is an ingame menu that can be toggled from within the game. It looks and functions a bit like MAME's OSD system. It is possible now to configure most of RetroArch's settings from this builtin menu instead of having to exit the game and go to an 'external' settings menu.\n
        * (RGUI) Added a 'Game History' list.\n
        * (RGUI) Added sophisticated shader stacking - for Cg shaders.\n
        * (RGUI/Libretro) Add disk image swapping - supported by Mednafen PSX and PCSX ReARMed\n
        * (Libretro) Add libretro GL capability to libretro API. Supported currently by PC, Android,
        iOS, Blackberry, Raspberry Pi, and Pandora. Targets either GL 2.0 or GL ES 2.0. Targeting
        GL ES 2.0 is encouraged for maximum portability to mobile platforms.\n
        * (Libretro/RGUI) Add Core Options. This makes it possible to 'expose' options for a libretro
        core to the frontend.\n
        * (Libretro) Add SET_SUPPORT_NO_GAME to API.\n
        * (RGUI) Change menu layout options.\n
        * (Menus) Standardize RGUI, RMenu and RMenu XUI to look and work the same.\n
        * (Overlays/RGUI) Overlays can now be scaled and their opacity changed from RGUI).\n
        * (RMenu/RGUI) Add text scrolling when a text string is too large to fit onscreen.\n
        * (ZIP support) Switch from builtin zlib to miniz - less codebloat.\n
        * [SNES9x Next] No longer disable high resolution for SA-1 games for Xbox 1 / Wii / Gamecube\n

        * [SNES9x Next] Add Core Option - 'SuperFX Overclock'.\n
        * [SNES9x Next] [Gamecube/Wii] Use sthbrx/stwbrx for READ_WORD/WRITE_WORD macros - speedup.\n
        * [Gambatte] Fixed serious input reporting bug on libretro side that could drastically slow down gameplay speed - found an edge case in a Japanese Pokemon Blue version that triggered this.\n
        * [Gambatte] Make colorization optional and not enforced through use of a Core Option.\n
        * [FCEUmm] Should load UNIF ROM format now.\n
        * [NEStopia] Fixes Famicom Disk System support.\n
        * [NEStopia] L/R now inserts coins on Vs. System games.\n
        * [NEStopia] Add Core Option 'Sprite Limit'.\n
        * [Mednafen] Add several Core Options for Mednafen PSX, Mednafen PCE Fast, Mednafen Neo Geo Pocket Color, etc.\n
        * [Mednafen PSX] Add disk swap mechanisms - exposed through RGUI\n
        * [PCSX ReARMed] Latest update to r19 from notaz (main author)\n
        * [PCSX ReARMed] Totally rewritten ARM code by notaz in order to support outdated version of Apple's GAS (for iOS support).\n
        * [PCSX ReARMed] Add disk swap mechanisms - exposed through RGUI\n
        * [PCSX ReARMed] Add m3u Mednafen-style cuesheet support\n
        * [PCSX ReARMed] Add core option 'Frameskip' - users with bad performance on Android should try out if setting this higher than 0 fixes their problems.\n
        * [PCSX ReARMed] Add core options 'NEON enhanced resolution' and 'NEON enhanced resolution speedhack' - this is for systems with ARM NEON CPUs. Note that this will easily triple or even quadruple CPU requirements. If you have an underpowered CPU, you might want to try this out in combination with the 'Frameskip' option (setting it higher than 0) to make things somewhat playable.\n
        * [Genesis Plus GX] Latest compatibility updates from ekeeke (main author)\n
        * [Genesis Plus GX] Add Core Options for blargg NTSC, Overscan and Game Gear Extend Screen\n

        * (LIBRETRO) NXEngine / Cave Story is now completely playable on consoles\n
        (Wii/PlayStation3/Xbox 1/Xbox 360) thanks to many code alterations. Performance is also much improved on the platforms which could already play them, such as Android and PC.\n
        * (Shaders) New shaders- mdapt, new xBR versions, new Harlequin Gameboy/LCD shaders, etc.\n
\n
        r12 (Feb 16, 2013)\n\n
* [NEStopia] Famicom Disk System support. For Android users - put disksys.rom
into the same folder as the FDS ROM you're trying to load. For everyone else -
put disksys.rom into your system directory.\n
  - Y Button will switch sides of a disk.\n
  - If you get any problems of the sort DISK A / B ERR 07' - pressing Y button again or letting it run its course should do it.\n
  - NOTE - Famicom Disk System loading is slow, so you might be tempted to fast forward through most of it. However, I'd advise caution when doing so and to savestate regularly in case 'fast forwarding' can negatively affect disk loading.\n
* [FBA core] Various changes/fixes\n
- Hook up Eco Fighters controls (Turn 1/Turn 2 bound to L and R buttons)\n
- Hook up Pnickie controls (Turn 1/Turn 2 bound to L and R buttons - press

        * Added a built-in help system that should answer a lot of the frequently asked questions.\n
        * Add iCade profiles - two added for now - iPega and Red Samurai\n
        * [Android] Audio resampler now faster\n
        * Input autodetection expanded -\n
        - PC2JAMMA-USB (needs to be tested)\n

        - Zeemote Steelseries\n
        - Saitek Rumblepad\n

        * Better multi-touch controls.\n
        * Ability to set opacity of overlays.\n

        - Madcatz PS3 fighting stick\n

        * FBA core - fixed a serious bug causing graphic glitches.\n
        * Nestopia core - use mono sound like the real NES.\n
        * Genesis Plus GX - Lunar Eternal Blue (JP) works again.\n
        \n
        r8 (Jan 30, 2013) - VERSION 0.9.8.1\n\n
        * Is now compatible with Android version 2.3 and up.\n

        - DragonRise USB Gamepad\n
        \n
        r6 (Jan 29, 2013)\n\n

        - Should fix emu crashing on some devices due to memory mapping issues.\n
        * New system-specific overlays added - on new installs only these new ones will be there and the old bad ones will no longer be there.

If you're still unsatisfied, nothing is stopping you from editing these files yourself with a text editor and an image editor - it's really simple to do.\n
        * New 'custom binding' when you turn off 'Configuration Autodetect Enable' - allows you to manually put in button mapping in case we don't support your pad. Note - it's probably more reliable right now to select the 'keycode' from the dropdown list instead of pressing the button on the pad.\n
        - Input autodetection expanded -\n
        - Trust Raptor\n
        - Should fix Logitech F710/Elecom/RetroUSB NES/etc\n
