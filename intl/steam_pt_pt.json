   "main-desc": "O RetroArch é um interface/estrutura multiplataforma de código aberto para emuladores, sistemas de jogo, videojogos, reprodutores multimédia e outras aplicações.\n\nEmbora possa fazer muitas outras coisas, é mais conhecido por permitir executar jogos clássicos numa grande variedade de computadores e consolas através de uma interface gráfica elegante. As opções também são unificadas assim que a configuração é feita de uma vez por todas.\n\nAlém disso, será possível em breve executar discos de jogos originais (CDs) no RetroArch. Levamos a sério a preservação dos videojogos e queremos garantir que ainda pode executar o conteúdo adquirido mais antigo nos PCs modernos.\n\nO RetroArch tem recursos avançados como sombreadores, jogo em rede, rebobinamento, tempos de resposta do próximo quadro, execução antecipada e muito mais!",
   "final-burn-neo-desc": "[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/FBN_a2.png[/img]\n\nO Final Burn Neo (também conhecido como FBNeo) é o novo produto oficial do emulador Final Burn Alpha, que é compatível com centenas de jogos de arcada e de consola. O núcleo libretro do FBNeo traz sua biblioteca de títulos compatíveis para o RetroArch, onde a forte integração do núcleo com a API libretro permite que ele funcione com os recursos avançados de flexão de tempo do RetroArch, como jogo em rede com reversão e redução de latência de execução antecipada. Inclui predefinições de entrada para mapeamento automático de botões para diferentes jogos, incluindo esquemas de jogos de luta para controlos de arcada modernos e da velha guarda (também conhecidos como paus de combate).",
   "genesis-plus-gx-desc": "[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/Genesis_Plus_GX_(Phone).png[/img]\r\n\r\nGenesis Plus GX began as a homebrew port of the Genesis Plus emulator for a hacked console before being ported to libretro. With a focus on speed, accuracy and portability, Genesis Plus GX now appears on a variety of platforms and frontends, and is known as one of the most capable and compatible emulators for the consoles it covers, with support for both cartridge and CD-ROM games. It also works well with many of RetroArch's advanced features, such as real-time rewind, run-ahead latency reduction, cheats and RetroAchievements.",
   "kronos-desc": "[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/main.png[/img]\r\n\r\nKronos is a modern fork of the UoYabause emulator, which is itself a fork of the venerable Yabause emulator. This DLC provides the Kronos-libretro core for use with the RetroArch gaming and multimedia interface, allowing users to load software that is compatible with the Kronos emulator.\r\n\r\nKronos utilizes modern OpenGL capabilities to provide a variety of extra graphical features, such as increased internal resolution, so an up-to-date and reasonably powerful GPU is recommended.\r\n\r\nKronos supports loading games from many different formats, including ISO, BIN/CUE and the compressed CHD format, and it requires external BIOS files (saturn_bios.bin and stvbios.zip) placed either in RetroArch's \"system\" folder or alongside the target software in order to function correctly.",
   "mesen-desc": "[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/mesen2.png[/img]\r\n\r\nMesen is a highly accurate and feature-filled emulator with support for tons of cartridge mappers (even ones used for weird, unauthorized carts), custom color palettes and HD asset packs. As a libretro core, Mesen supports many advanced features, like softpatching and achievements (through the RetroAchievements service).",

   "mgba-desc": "[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/mgba.png[/img]\r\n\r\nmGBA is a fast, accurate emulator for one of the most popular and well-loved handheld consoles, and it has compatibility with huge library of beloved 8- and 16-bit style games. On top of the commitment to speed and faithful reproduction, mGBA also has a ton of great enhancement features, including support for custom palettes for games that were originally grayscale and displaying borders for games that include them.\r\n\r\nThis DLC allows mGBA to run through RetroArch, which adds all of its enhancements and features, including real-time rewind, extensive post-processing shaders and low-latency input to provide a modern gaming experience even with classic titles.",
   "pcsx-rearmed-desc": "[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/PCSX.png[/img]\r\n\r\nPCSX ReARMed is part of a long line of emulators that includes PCSX-Reloaded, PCSX-df and, of course, the original PCSX. This particular fork was originally heavily optimized for devices with ARM CPUs, hence the name, but we've added back in quite a few things to make it work well on typical PC hardware, as well.\r\n\r\nAs a libretro core, this DLC requires the RetroArch interface, where it can be loaded as a core to run games and software that are compatible with the PCSX ReARMed emulator. This core requires a BIOS image (not included) for each region of the software to be placed in RetroArch's \"system\" directory in order to function properly.",
   "sameboy-desc": "[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/SAMEBOY_(Phone).png[/img]\r\nSameBoy is a highly accurate emulator known for successfully running a few games that cause other emulators to stumble. In addition to this high accuracy, SameBoy also sports some nice features like the ability to pick which device model to emulate regardless of what model the game is designed for, user-selectable colorization palettes, built-in HLE BIOS and the ability to load borders on the games that support them.",
