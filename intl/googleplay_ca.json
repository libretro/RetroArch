Libretro is an interface that allows you to make cross-platform applications that can use rich features such as OpenGL, cross-platform camera support, location support, and more in the future.\n\nIt comes with its own built-in collection of applications to provide you with a 'one-stop-shop' for entertainment.\n\nLibretro and RetroArch are perfectly suited for creating games, emulators and multimedia programs.
