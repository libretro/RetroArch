   "main-desc": "RetroArch is an open source and cross platform frontend/framework for emulators, game engines, video games, media players and other applications.\n\nWhile it can do many things besides this, it is most widely known for enabling you to run classic games on a wide range of computers and consoles through a slick graphical interface. Settings are also unified so configuration is done once and for all.\n\nIn addition to this, you will soon be able to run original game discs (CDs) from RetroArch. We take videogame preservation seriously and want to ensure you can run your originally bought content on modern day PCs.\n\nRetroArch has advanced features like shaders, netplay, rewinding, next-frame response times, run-ahead, and more!",
   "final-burn-neo-desc": "[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/FBN_a2.png[/img]\r\n\r\nFinal Burn Neo (aka FBNeo) is the new official branch of the Final Burn Alpha emulator, which is compatible with hundreds of arcade and console games. The libretro core of FBNeo brings its library of compatible titles to RetroArch, where the core's tight integration with the libretro API allows it to work with RetroArch's advanced time-bending features like rollback-based netplay and run-ahead latency reduction. It includes input presets for automatic mapping of buttons for different games, including fighting game layouts for both modern and old-school arcade controls (aka fightsticks).",

   "kronos-desc": "[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/main.png[/img]\r\n\r\nKronos is a modern fork of the UoYabause emulator, which is itself a fork of the venerable Yabause emulator. This DLC provides the Kronos-libretro core for use with the RetroArch gaming and multimedia interface, allowing users to load software that is compatible with the Kronos emulator.\r\n\r\nKronos utilizes modern OpenGL capabilities to provide a variety of extra graphical features, such as increased internal resolution, so an up-to-date and reasonably powerful GPU is recommended.\r\n\r\nKronos supports loading games from many different formats, including ISO, BIN/CUE and the compressed CHD format, and it requires external BIOS files (saturn_bios.bin and stvbios.zip) placed either in RetroArch's \"system\" folder or alongside the target software in order to function correctly.",

   "pcsx-rearmed-desc": "[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/PCSX.png[/img]\r\n\r\nPCSX ReARMed is part of a long line of emulators that includes PCSX-Reloaded, PCSX-df and, of course, the original PCSX. This particular fork was originally heavily optimized for devices with ARM CPUs, hence the name, but we've added back in quite a few things to make it work well on typical PC hardware, as well.\r\n\r\nAs a libretro core, this DLC requires the RetroArch interface, where it can be loaded as a core to run games and software that are compatible with the PCSX ReARMed emulator. This core requires a BIOS image (not included) for each region of the software to be placed in RetroArch's \"system\" directory in order to function properly.",
   "sameboy-desc": "[img]{STEAM_APP_IMAGE}/extras/SAMEBOY_(Phone).png[/img]\r\nSameBoy is a highly accurate emulator known for successfully running a few games that cause other emulators to stumble. In addition to this high accuracy, SameBoy also sports some nice features like the ability to pick which device model to emulate regardless of what model the game is designed for, user-selectable colorization palettes, built-in HLE BIOS and the ability to load borders on the games that support them.",
