# MESA PreBuilt Libraries

The Binaries in this folder are compiled from a custom version of [MESA](https://github.com/aerisarn/mesa-uwp). 
These are based on this [branch](https://github.com/aerisarn/mesa-uwp/tree/alpha-2-hack-fixes), which is the
stable branch for MESA integration into Retroarch.
