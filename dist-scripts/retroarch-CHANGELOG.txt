------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.9.6
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* [VBA Next] Fixes serious regressions - most evident in Golden Sun games -
battle screens etc.
* [VBA Next] Add a core option to change the control button layout from (left
to right) B to A to (left to right) A to B.
* [Android] Added Load Game History to Android Java UI
* [Android] Will show a progressbar dialog during asset extraction so that the
user knows what is happening.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.9.5
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* [Android] Input autodetection fixes -
  - DualShock3 pad controls fixed
* [Android] It should now be possible to map D-pad to analog on several gamepads, such as:
  - Xbox 360
  - PlayStation3
  - Shield
* [Android] Threaded video is now the default due to positive user feedback. Purists and accuracy
people can still go for static syncing for best results - although for PCSX ReARMed threaded
video is essential. With the combination of threaded video and dynamic audio rate control,
most of the audio pops and sync issues should be a thing of the past now. Yay.
* [Android] UI has been reorganized and made less shitty (yes, we know). Still a long 
way to go there. The entire menu should be gamepad-controllable now at least.
* [Android] Shaders that were broken on Nexus 7/4/10 etc. should now work
* [Android] Added some additional autodetection rules:
  - Ouya: Input overlays are disabled by default
* [Android] Added high-latency audio option for crappy/old Android devices that
can't handle the lower-latency audio that is the default since 0.9.9.4. This should
give you the same performance as 0.9.9.3 (r17). Turn this on if you get bad sound/performance
(and it's not your device simply being slow). This might also apply for some of the newer 
devices - perhaps OpenSL driver has not been updated/optimized there.
* [Android] Added a TV mode. This will launch you straight into RGUI mode. This mode
is identical to what you get from the Wii and PC ports of RetroArch at startup. First
you select a core, then you select a game to go with it.
* [SNES9x] Fixes by Alcaro to libretro port
* [SNES9x Next] Fixes savestates from not being able to be loaded.
* (LIBRETRO) Added bsnes/higan performance core [v0.92] (Android).
  - bsnes/higan performance core will run all non-coprocessor games at fullspeed on an
  nVidia Shield.
  - Co-processor games (SuperFX/SA-1/DSP/Cx4/SA1) will run between ~40fps and 55-57fps 
  on an nVidia Shield - depending on the specific co-processor. Note - you will need
  BIOS files for these games - see byuu boards for information on them.
* [Mednafen NGP] Fixes input issues in a number of games, such as:
  - Card Fighters games
  - Etc.
* [Picodrive] Updates/32X compatibility/accuracy improvements
* [NEStopia] Updated to 1.46 WIP - added ability to load NstDatabase.xml, fixes Vs. System games
and Startropics 1/2
* [iOS] Only player 1 gets default keyboard bindings
* [iOS] Fixes PS3 gamepad bindings in RGUI
* [iOS] Fixes iCade button mappings
* [iOS] UI additions - Refresh / New Folder / Move options.
* [iOS] Some lifecycle management fixes - should deal better now with phone calls
received and then returning back to RA, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.9.3
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* [Android] Input autodetection expanded -
  - Xperia Play controls fixed once and for all (thanks to littleguy77)
  - JC U912F gamepad
* [GX] Fixed FPS reporting
* [iOS] Fixed input issues -
  - Rewrite of BTStack code
  - Multiple gamepad support
  - More reliable syncing/pairing
  - Cleanup of L2CAP commands
  - Stop Wiimote inquiry loops while game is running, fixes horrible lag
* [iOS] Add a 'TV Mode' option which forgoes the Cocoa file browser for
RGUI. NOTE: You might have trouble launching PS1 games from this mode
if they are the first ROM/ISO you load.
* [iOS] Shaders should work now. Note - for best results - set Scale
to 1x per shader pass. Quite a few shaders are fullspeed from iPad 2
and up - your mileage may vary depending on the device.
* [Blackberry] Fixed input issues -
  - Fixed a bug that caused random button presses on unmapped players
  - Better multitouch
* [Blackberry] Add ALSA QNX sound driver
* [GENERAL] Should fix GPU screenshots if last frame was duped
* [PCSX ReARMed] Add core option to switch between Dual Shock and regular
gamepad modes
* [TyrQuake] Add core option so that you can change the internal screen
resolution (note that TyrQuake uses the software renderer - it is slow -
an OpenGL ES option will be added in the future for mobile devices and
others)
* [TyrQuake] For RetroArch ports that support RETRO_KEYBOARD and RETRO_MOUSE -
mouse/keyboard controls should work now
* [Genesis Plus GX] Updated to the latest version - 1.7.4 -
  - fixed SRAM incompatibilities between BIG ENDIAN & LITTLE ENDIAN platforms 
  for libretro (note: this breaks old .srm files with LITTLE ENDIAN platform ports -
  which includes iOS, Android, PC) 
  - A lot of compatibility/maintenance fixes by ekeeke (main author) - see
  this for more - https://github.com/libretro/Genesis-Plus-GX/commit/11d275e2f881d5eefac9d9473db3fc3d52f19c75
* [MAME 2003] 'game might not run correctly. Press any key to continue' games can be run
now - such as Tekken 2
* [MAME 2003] Correct resolutions for Namco System 11 games
* [MAME 2003] Some minor optimizations (very slight though)
* (NXEngine/Cave Story) Big-endian background garbage bug fixed - should make game play
correctly in those parts on PS3/Gamecube/Wii/Xbox 360. (http://forum.themaister.net/viewtopic.php?id=415&p=2)

v0.9.9.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* (LIBRETRO) Added MAME 2003 [0.78] (PC/Android/iOS)
* (MAME 2003 0.78) Add speedhack core option so that MAME can run at fullspeed on average Cortex A9 CPUs for games like Mortal Kombat 2/3/Ultimate/NBA Jam (DCS sound harware games)
* Can take screenshots now with libretro GL cores
* [RGUI] Saves video shader directory to config file.

browser root to any directory.
* [iOS] Add system settings to enable or disable certain orientations while
a game is running.
* [iOS] Add refresh button to file browser

* [Blackberry 10] Add core info on BB10 for more cores.
* [Blackberry 10] Clean up input a bit, fix multiple devices issue.
* [Blackberry 10] Hide overlay on Q10 and when controllers are mapped. Add RGUI
toggle to controllers.
* [Blackberry] Fix the overlay not cycling past minimized

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.9
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* (iOS) Initial release of RetroArch iOS.
* (Blackberry) Initial release of RetroArch Blackberry (for BB10/Playbook).
* [SNES9x Next] No longer disable high resolution for SA-1 games for Xbox 1 /
Wii / Gamecube
* [SNES9x Next] Seiken Densetsu 3/Romancing Saga 3 no longer downsample to
low-resolution for high-resolution modes on Xbox 1/Gamecube/Wii
* [SNES9x Next] Add Core Option - 'SuperFX Overclock'.
* [SNES9x Next] [Gamecube/Wii] Use sthbrx/stwbrx for READ_WORD/WRITE_WORD macros - speedup.
* [Gambatte] Fixed serious input reporting bug on libretro side that could
drastically slow down gameplay speed - found an edge case in a Japanese
Pokemon Blue version that triggered this.

* [PCSX ReARMed] Add disk swap mechanisms - exposed through RGUI
* [PCSX ReARMed] Add m3u Mednafen-style cuesheet support
* [PCSX ReARMed] Add core option 'Frameskip' - users with bad performance on Android should try out if setting this higher than 0 fixes their problems.
* [PCSX ReARMed] Add core options 'NEON enhanced resolution' and 'NEON enhanced resolution speedhack' - this is for systems with ARM NEON CPUs. Note that this will easily triple or even quadruple CPU requirements. If you have an underpowered CPU, you might want to try this out in combination with the 'Frameskip' option (setting it higher than 0) to make things somewhat playable.
* [Genesis Plus GX] Latest compatibility updates from ekeeke (main author)
* [Genesis Plus GX] Add Core Options for blargg NTSC, Overscan and Game Gear Extend Screen
* [Final Burn Alpha] Add several Core Options for going tO Service Mode, Resetting game, etc.
* (LIBRETRO) Added Tyrquake
* (LIBRETRO) Added ModelViewer and SceneWalker (for platforms which support
libretro GL).
* (LIBRETRO) NXEngine / Cave Story is now completely playable on consoles
(Wii/PlayStation3/Xbox 1/Xbox 360) thanks to many code alterations. Performance
is also much improved on the platforms which could already play them, such as
Android and PC.
* (Shaders) New shaders- mdapt, new xBR versions, new Harlequin Gameboy/LCD shaders, etc.
* Threaded video option. Mainly for Android users but works for OpenGL driver in general.
* (Android) Add iControlPad support.
* (Android) Add the following gamepads / etc to autodetection list:
   - Tommo NeoGeoX Arcade Stick
   - Xperia Play (fixes ANR issues after 30 seconds)
   - TTT THT pad
   - JXD S7300B
   - Sega Virtua Stick
   - Ouya pad (untested)
   - Gamestop Wireless
   - Tomee NES USB
   - Thrustmaster T Mini Wireless
* (Android) Add back key behavior - can either 'toggle' RGUI' on/off or exit the app.
* (RGUI) RGUI now works on PC, Android, iOS and Blackberry - and is no longer Wii-exclusive.
* (RGUI) RGUI is an ingame menu that can be toggled from within the game. It looks and functions a bit like MAME's OSD system. It is possible now to configure most of RetroArch's settings from this builtin menu instead of having to exit the game and go to an 'external' settings menu.
* (RGUI) Added a 'Game History' list.
* (RGUI) Added sophisticated shader stacking - for Cg shaders.
* (RGUI/Libretro) Add disk image swapping - supported by Mednafen PSX and PCSX ReARMed.
* (Libretro) Add libretro GL capability to libretro API. Supported currently by PC, Android, iOS, Blackberry, Raspberry Pi, and Pandora. Targets either GL 2.0 or GL ES 2.0. Targeting GL ES 2.0 is encouraged for maximum portability to mobile platforms.
* (Libretro/RGUI) Add Core Options. This makes it possible to 'expose' options for a libretro core to the frontend.
* (Libretro) Add SET_SUPPORT_NO_GAME to API.
* (RGUI) Change menu layout options.
* (PS3) Optimize PS3 video driver extensively - should result in a big latency reduction.
* (PS3) Totally remove the 'old' fixed 2-pass shader system and replace it with a new, forward-compatible with PC 8-pass shader stacking system. RGUI/RMenu makes CGP files dynamically as you set new shader stacks.
* (Wii) Optimize Wii video driver by using inlined macros for certain fixed-function state code.
* (360/Xbox 1) Optimize 360/Xbox 1 video drivers by using inlined command buffer macros
* (360) Removed shader system for this release - will be re-added in a future 0.9.9 point release. The main problem is that on Xbox 360, all our render targets need to fit inside 10MB of EDRAM - which is just pathetic if you want to have any FBO scaling options similar to what can be done on PS3. I'll be looking at either tiled rendering or just implementing the same 'hack' I did before (where I forcibly set the maximum source framebuffer resolution at 512x512 for two-pass shaders and hoped nobody would notice so I could stay within the confines of the 10MB of EDRAM for render targets). For now, the PS3 port is way superior than the 360 port in the graphics stakes due to this 10MB EDRAM limitation for render targets.
* (Menus) Standardize RGUI, RMenu and RMenu XUI to look and work the same.
* (Overlays/RGUI) Overlays can now be scaled and their opacity changed from RGUI).
* (RMenu/RGUI) Add text scrolling when a text string is too large to fit onscreen.
* (RMenu XUI) Have all menu screens now use the same basic XUI template. Cuts down on a lot of code maintenance at the expense of language customization by end-users. A solution will be looked at later.
* (Xbox 1) Slim down on menu texture - leaves us with more free RAM to play with - only tested on 480p - somebody with 720p/1080i resolution support should contact me - even though I'm afraid making the menu texture any bigger is going to be a waste of RAM anyways. Upsides of this are obvious - far faster switching between menu and game and consumes way less RAM which means games like Street Fighter Alpha 3 and Vampire Savior now fit into RAM without pesky and slow file I/O-based VM.
* (Wii) Add additional VI resolutions.
* (ZIP support) Switch from builtin zlib to miniz - less codebloat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.8.4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* [NEStopia] Famicom Disk System support. For Android users - put disksys.rom
into your system directory.
  - Y Button will switch sides of a disk. 
  - If you get any problems of the sort DISK A / B ERR 07' - pressing Y button again or letting it run its course should do it.
  - NOTE - Famicom Disk System loading is slow, so you might be tempted to fast forward through most of it. However, I'd advise caution when doing so and to savestate regularly in case 'fast forwarding' can negatively affect disk loading. 
* [FBA core] Various changes/fixes
- Hook up Eco Fighters controls (Turn 1/Turn 2 bound to L and R buttons)
- Hook up Pnickie controls (Turn 1/Turn 2 bound to L and R buttons - press
one of the buttons to progress beyond start screen)

Neogeo and Mega Drive/PC Engine drivers removed. To play CPS1, use FBA Cores CPS1. 
 To play CPS2, use FBA Cores CPS2. To play NeoGeo, use FBA Cores Neo.
* [FBA core] Made FBA Cores CPS1 - use this to play CPS1 games (all CPS1 ROMs
fit into memory on Gamecube).
* [Android] Fixed regression where a button bound to AKEYCODE_BACK would 'exit out'
of RetroArch.
* [Android] Fixes Madcatz fighting stick being autodetected properly.
* [Android] Input autodetection expanded -
  - iControlpad
* [Gamecube] Made RetroArch cores 'standalone' - ie. no core switching.

such as Street Fighter Alpha 3/Vampire Savior and other big ROMs in FBA Cores CPS2/NeoGeo/FBA.
* [Unzipping [All consoles/Android]] Moved from rzlib to miniz/minizip -should increase compatibility
with ZIP archives

* [Genesis Plus GX] Set samplerate back to 44Khz.
* [Android] New 'Calibrate Refresh Rate' option - use this to get an accurate estimation of your screen refresh rate. NOTE: Touch the screen at all times during calibration for more accurate measurements. You might have to slightly tweak the value later on for the best results.
* [Android] Added a 'Set OS-reported refresh rate' which should do the same as what 'Sync refreshrate to Screen' previously did. Note 2 users might get better results with this than they will with 'Calibrate refresh rate'.
* [Android] Added a built-in help system that should answer a lot of the frequently asked questions.
* ]Android] Add iCade profiles - two added for now - iPega and Red Samurai
* [Android] Audio resampler now faster
* [Android] Input autodetection expanded -
* [CONSOLES] Audio resampler is now adjustable - can choose between Sinc resampler (new) and Hermite resampler (old). Sinc is now selected by default, is superior audio-quality wise and will fix a lot of sound issues.
* [PS3] Save Preset fixed
* [PS3] Starting with Dual Shader/Custom Scaling mode OFF and then turning it ON works now
* [Wii] Numerous Wii video mode fixes - including PAL modes that went beyond the internal framebuffer bounds
- PC2JAMMA-USB (needs to be tested)

gets loaded or when RetroArch shuts down)
- (RARCH_CONSOLE) All console ports now use 59.94Hz for synchronization on 
the RetroArch side instead of 59.92Hz as before. All consoles use 59.94Hz 
so this agrees better with them.
