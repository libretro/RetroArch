# This script will upload the packaged RetroArch cores to a WiiU running
# FTPiiU or FTPiiU Anywhere

# IMPORTANT: This script assumes the following structure
#
# WARNING: I experienced corrupt uploads when using Dimok's FTPiiU. You
# probably want to use FIX94's FTPiiU Anywhere.
#
# After uploading everything, the script will re-download the RPX files and
# compare their hash and print an error if the file was corrupted.
#
# The WiiU's IP address can be specified by either setting the WIIU_IP_ADDRESS
# environment variable, or by configuring the wiiu-devel.properties file

# The path to the parent directory of your retroarch/ and wiiu/ folders, as
# visible in FTPiiU.
